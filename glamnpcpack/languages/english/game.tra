On my mother's grave, I will kill every hippogriff I see to the end of my life. Stinking beasts stomped my Thundercat into the dirt. Even now, with her wounds treated, she won't wake up. The healer says he doesn't know if she will. I wave sardines beneath her nose, I poke her in the belly, for which she has never before failed to punish me, even from the deepest slumber, and yet still she lies unaware on her pillow, quiet as death.

You pull through, you old hag. Don't leave me alone in this wretched world.


4 Alturiak, 1358:
Thundercat is awake and alert, but not whole. I am told the injuries to her head were too severe to mend fully, and now she mews and growls where once she spoke as eruditely as I.

It pains her. I can see it. She hides it well, as she hides everything besides her ire, but I've had her at my side too long to be fooled. She has not forgotten herself, what she used to be. She knows what is gone.

I've never felt such unbearable helplessness! I had every blasted medic in the regiment up by their collars, demanding solutions, finding none. There is magic to heal even the deepest afflictions, they say, but none of the sort I can afford.

Perhaps, instead, it could be earned.

Rejected. Rejected everywhere. Tempus spurns me for favouring spellbook over sword, while the Lady of Strategy tuts at my impatience.

Tell me, what is selfish in the wish to heal a friend? I will ask them such when next I visit. Bastards.


1 Tarsakh, 1358:
The Ilmatari shrine is destroyed! I returned to present my case anew and found only rubble and corpses, and the telltale black streaks of magical electric discharge. A scene of terrible carnage.

And yet, I find myself unmoved; even, dare I say, gratified to witness their smug piety torn down and left in ruins. Perhaps a dose of healthy self-interest would have seen them with more than wooden staffs and begging bowls to defend themselves from whomever did this.

There is a trail here.


5 Tarsakh, 1358:
My hunt led to a cavern in the mountains, and to a woman dressed in steel and leather, who wore a silver bolt of lightning around her neck. She attacked the moment she saw me, perhaps assuming I had come to pay justice for Ilmater's fallen, but a captain of the War Wizards is no easy foe.

We fought to a stalemate, until we both lay drained and breathless on the cold stone. Only then did she ask my name and my purpose. I said that I sought the destroyer of the Ilmatari shrine, and she told me I had found her. I said that I commended her thoroughness, and she laughed a longer laugh than I have ever heard. Thus, our acquaintance made, we set our weapons aside and settled by the fire to recuperate.

She tells me she knows a thing or two of divine power, and of a short path to walk for those who seek it, and I know from our battle that she speaks true.

@258  = ~Oh, *is* it? I had no idea!~
@259  = ~No, I mean, I don't think you realise the extent of it. Wild surges aren't repeatable, so nobody can really study them. Nobody knows the limits of what they can do.~
@260  = ~Obviously nothing earthshattering's happened yet, or we'd have heard of it. But there's a first time for everything. One day, maybe even tomorrow, you might cast a little cantrip for convenience, and somewhere in the world, an entire nation of people gets shunted to the Abyss.~
@261  = ~Uh...~
@262  = ~Sleep tight.~
@263  = ~Oh gods. Oh, Vynd. I'm so sorry.~
@264  = ~What?~
@265  = ~It was another surge, I...I didn't mean it, I swear. Don't worry, I don't think it's anything life-threatening. Just...don't look in any mirrors, okay?~
@266  = ~What happened? <CHARNAME>, what's she talking about?~
@267  = ~It's alright, it's alright! I'll probably wear off in a week or two. Don't touch it, though. It might spread.~
@268  = ~WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?~
@269  = ~Ew! Don't shout! You're making it ooze!~
@270  = ~Alright. Fair game. We'll call it a tie for now.~
@271  = ~Hah!~
@272  = ~You monks are supposed to be wise. Explain the point of training for years to kill a man with your fists when you'd get faster results with a knife.~
@273  = ~I do not train to kill. I train to improve myself.~
@274  = ~Yeah, to improve your ability to kill.~
@275  = ~To improve *myself*, in every aspect. It just so happens that one of those aspects is combat.~
@276  = ~Okay, so practice with your fists to "improve yourself." When it's time to hurt someone, grab something sharp. Easy.~
@277  = ~A weapon is easily dropped, or broken. One cannot disarm a man of his hands.~
@278  = ~Yeah you can. I've done it. Takes a little more effort, but...~
@279  = ~Shall we spar, then? Perhaps you will convince me.~
@280  = ~Uh...sure. But to test it properly, I'll have to start behind you, in the dark, with a poisoned blade. It's how I do things.~
@281  = ~By all means. I would welcome the challenge.~
@282  = ~...never mind.~
@283  = ~Is this pit of yours an exclusive thing? Do you have to be "on the list", or can anyone get a seat?~
@284  = ~Both. It's invitation-only, but my guards have a weakness. When they see enough gold, they go blind.~
@285  = ~You know they take bribes?~
@286  = ~I *instruct* them to take bribes.~
@287  = ~It's all salesmanship, my stupid little surfacer. If you run an honest, upstanding business, you'll get honest, upstanding clientele. Not the sort of people who frequent fighting pits.~
@288  = ~If you want to rake 'em in, you need a proper, seedy, degenerate den, a blasphemy against everything wholesome. Backhanders, cheating, unregulated gambling, questionable substances...people come as much for what's outside the arena as what's in it.~
@289  = ~So if me and a few boys from the church broke in, downed a few flagons and threw drunken lightning bolts at the contestants, you'd approve?~
@290  = ~That sounds magnificent! Although I make no promises as to where you'll wake up. Or if.~
@291  = ~Baeloth?~
@292  = ~Ah! What? What do you want?~
@293  = ~...I was going to say you seem a bit jumpy.~
@294  = ~Jumpy? I would call myself calm and composed, considering every one of these wretched surfaceborn maggots wants me dead!~
@295  = ~Vynd doesn't seem to have that problem.~
@296  = ~Because I act like I belong. People see me walk down the street like anyone else, they say "Oh, a drow. That's strange. But he's obviously meant to be here, or he'd be hiding his face and skulking around."~
@297  = ~Now guess what happens when you hide your face and skulk around.~
@298  = ~Besides, you're never safe in the Underdark either, are you? Someone always wants to kill you. At least up here you can see it coming.~
@299  = ~But you're never safe in the Underdark either, are you? Someone always wants to kill you. At least up here you can see it coming.~
@300  = ~Different matter altogether! It's all subtlety in the Underdark. Shadows and schemes. That game, I know how to play. I've never lost, in fact, or I wouldn't be alive.~
@301  = ~There aren't any games on the surface, just brute idiot force. And no gambit, no matter how brilliant, will stop your opponent from flipping the board and punching you in the face. ~
@302  = ~You could just say "I had an invincible djinni bouncer and now I don't."~
@303  = ~If you knew the answer, why did you ask?~
@304  = ~That's more or less what small talk is.~
@305  = ~Dorn, could you teach me to be more like you? More...you know, intimidating?~
@306  = ~See, like that. That's exactly what I mean. I nearly wet my britches and all you did was ask me to repeat myself.~
@307  = ~Intimidation is not an act. It is a state of being.~
@308  = ~If ever I decided to kill you, I could and would without a moment's notice. As long as you know that, I do not need to *make* you fear me.~
@309  = ~The matter is one of power. And if you seek more, there is always...hmm.~
@310  = ~I meant to offer you my patron's services.~
@311  = ~And?~
@312  = ~He is outraged that I even considered it.~
@313  = ~...soul-selling's out, then.~
@314  = ~It appears so.~
@315  = ~Ever considered worshipping Talos, Dorn?~
@316  = ~I have no need of gods.~
@317  = ~Aw, come on. It's all about spreading fear and destruction and taking what you want. You wouldn't have to change at all. Just, next time you eviscerate someone, tilt your head back and yell "For Talos!"~
@318  = ~And what would I be given in return?~
@319  = ~Well, you get to heal people, and cure diseases, and, uh, there's a lot of protection spells, those are always helpful...~
@320  = ~Not interested.~
@321  = ~And lightning bolts. You can throw lightning bolts.~
@322  = ~...hmm.~
@323  = ~You'd have to ditch the sword though. No blades.~
@324  = ~Why?~
@325  = ~I don't know, Dorn. I really don't.~
@326  = ~Hold on, this isn't fair. He can just play the "Talos worshipper" card and-~
@327  = ~He is a spineless boy barely fit for cattle rearing.~
@328  = ~Oh. Okay then.~
@329  = ~I wonder why there's no such thing as a wild cleric. Talos already likes us blowing things up at random. Might as well go all the way.~
@330  = ~For your information, most of my surges don't blow anything up. Those are just the ones people remember.~
@331  = ~You think so? I don't know, I like the stranger ones. I get enough careless destruction from...well, from myself.~
@332  = ~You *like* them?~
@333  = ~If there's one thing I never want to be, it's bored. So as long as you're around, I'm safe.~
@334  = ~Cast away, I say. Whatever happens, you're alright with me.~
@335  = ~Aww, thanks! Who knew priests of horrible carnage could be so sweet?~
@336  = ~Almost no-one. Unfortunately.~
@337  = ~I think religion could help you with your problem, Neera.~
@338  = ~Oh, great. Here come the empty promises. "Find inner fulfilment, centre yourself and all the magic will disappear somehow..."~
@339  = ~No no, think about it. Priests' magic never causes wild surges, right? So if you took that energy and put it into divine spells...~
@340  = ~Huh.~
@341  = ~Who would I be a priest of, though? Don't say Talos.~
@342  = ~Ta-~
@343  = ~Oh, come on. What else am I going to tell you?~
@344  = ~Do you know how Talos was formed, Rasaad?~
@345  = ~From the first battle between Selune and Shar. He and many others.~
@346  = ~I love that story. It says a lot about potential.~
@347  = ~All those gods started off as splinters of the most ancient beings in the world. Just accidents. Run-off. And now they have as much power and influence as either of them. I hope you're not going to punch me for saying that.~
@348  = ~Words alone never merit violence, Dave.~
@349  = ~What if the words are "Prepare to die, scum"?~
@350  = ~Even then.~
@351  = ~Prepare to die, scum!~
@352  = ~Just checking. Well done.~
@353  = ~I've been thinking some more about that creation story, Rasaad. All the gods created from Selune and Shar's battle, all the people who revere them...that's an awful lot of worship that could have gone to one of those two instead.~
@354  = ~Do you think they'd still have fought if they'd known they'd be creating all that competition?~
@355  = ~Without doubt. Light cannot exist without banishing darkness. Conflict is inevitable.~
@356  = ~But nothing came of it. Nothing ever comes of it. If they'd just left each other alone, they'd be in the same place they are now, but with less scars.~
@357  = ~Are you trying to tell me something?~
@358  = ~Am I? People ask me that a lot, but most of the time I'm just rambling.~
@359  = ~A fellow blackguard? And pleasing enough to the eye. Perhaps this diversion shall prove worthwhile yet.~
@360  = ~Pleasing enough? I wouldn't hold my breath after that, tuskface.~
@361  = ~So, drow. You say you used to wield more power than this?~
@362  = ~MUCH more! If I were even half of what I used to be, I'd be back where I belong this very minute. Instead I'm marching through the muck with you MISERABLE-~
@363  = ~*If so*, our circumstances are not so different. In magnitude, perhaps, but little else. I suppose it would be fitting to commiserate.~
@364  = ~You mean...sympathise?~
@365  = ~I believe that's another word for it, yes.~
@366  = ~Well. Yes. Well.~
@367  = ~I...understand what you're going through?~
@368  = ~I know you do. We just established that.~
@369  = ~Isn't that what you say, though? To sympathise? I don't know. I've never done it.~
@370  = ~Ah. Nor have I, as it happens.~
@371  = ~...this isn't making me feel better.~
@372  = ~Yes, quite. Forget I said anything.~
@373  = ~I've heard humans have their own bloodsports. Cockfights, they're called.~
@374  = ~Cockfights?~
@375  = ~Chickens. They raise chickens to duel one another.~
@376  = ~Really? Those flightless feathery things? How dull.~
@377  = ~Why so? You consider yourself above surfacers, but you're quite content to watch them peck one another's eyes out.~
@378  = ~I simply don't understand the appeal of watching one's lessers butt heads. Seems to me it's all artless spectacle.~
@379  = ~Oh, it is. Of course it is. Nothing wrong with artless spectacle. I only say it's dull because chickens don't beg for their worthless lives.~
@380  = ~...do they?~
@381  = ~No.~
@382  = ~Damn. Thought I had something there.~
@383  = ~I for one hope your story is true, sorceress. A dragon's head would make quite the trophy.~
@384  = ~Not a single person has acted on those words and lived.~
@385  = ~I am ever keen to tread new ground.~
@386  = ~And I am keen to tread you into it. Do not test me, mongrel. Even now, I am your better.~
@387  = ~"Mongrel."~
@388  = ~When my vengeance is complete, I shall find you again, and we will learn the truth.~
@389  = ~So. "Blackguard", is it? I admit, you are the first of your kind I've met. Many would call it madness to bargain with one's soul, but it reaped its fair share of rewards for you, did it not?~
@390  = ~Is that temptation I hear in your voice? With the right incentive, I could be persuaded to share...~
@391  = ~No. I have no need of borrowed power.~
@392  = ~Which brings me to my point. Apparently you do.~
@393  = ~Watch your tongue. My patron and I struck a bargain that suited us both. I do not "need" him.~
@394  = ~Indeed, I'm sure you've otherwise crushed every obstacle in your path. Only when presented with a locked door do you need to sell yourself into thraldom for extraplanar assistance.~
@395  = ~You honestly think yourself stronger for what you did? No. You are bound and leashed now, a dog feeding from his master's scraps. Freed from one prison, only to crawl into another. Many would call it madness, yes. I call it weakness.~
@396  = ~I did what had to be done, woman, and I would do it again. Die proud and defiant if it suits you, but you will die all the same, while those with real mettle live on.~
@397  = ~This is beneath ridicule. Really, <CHARNAME>.~
@398  = ~Her delusions of dragonhood make her unpredictable.~
@399  = ~Damnation, girl! Can you not control these outbursts of yours?~
@400  = ~Here's the thing, Flara. If I could control them, I'D DO IT.~
@401  = ~Naturally. Forgive me for having any expectations whatsoever.~
@402  = ~"Wild magic" indeed. No dragon has ever suffered such an affliction, I can tell you that.~
@403  = ~Well maybe you should spend more time with dragons and less with us.~
@404  = ~Hint hint.~
@405  = ~Thank you, yes. I know it's rare among your people, but I do understand subtext.~
@406  = ~I've conducted some research on your magic, Neera. I believe I've reconsidered my stance.~
@407  = ~Let me guess. You've heard that wild surges sometimes create gold or gems, and now you're going to oh-so-subtly suggest I should cast more spells.~
@408  = ~For pride's sake, I contend I had no intention of being subtle.~
@409  = ~Have you ever tried meditation, Flara?~
@410  = ~The least productive pastime in the cosmos? No.~
@411  = ~Ah, you mistake it for idleness. Perhaps it is, in a sense, but achieving tranquillity of mind is-~
@412  = ~I'm not mistaking it for anything, fool. I know it's more than sitting cross-legged. That's precisely why I condemn it. Only a human would extol the virtues of an empty head.~
@413  = ~The mind...or should I say, my mind...is a furnace. It creates, it shapes, it destroys, and it is useless quenched.~
@414  = ~It may help you find contentment in what you are, rather than striving to be something else.~
@415  = ~Or to rephrase, "Give up." No. I have never in my life settled for less, and I don't intend to start now.~
@416  = ~I would never encourage giving up. But there is a difference between overcoming thirst and simply neglecting to drink.~
@417  = ~(One. Two. Three. Four.)~
@418  = ~You can stay there all <DAYNIGHT>, monk. I won't be joining you.~
@419  = ~I will not force you, but it can do you no harm to try. It is a simple breathing exercise. (One. Two.)~
@420  = ~There is only one breathing exercise I care to perform, and you'd be well-advised to stand clear. And I will *not* sit in that stupid position.~
@421  = ~Sit however makes you comfortable. (One. Two. Three.)~
@422  = ~Well I certainly don't plan to stand here and count aloud like some infant learning their numbers.~
@423  = ~Count in silence if you prefer. (One. Two.)~
@424  = ~This is ridiculous! If there is no correct method then how can there be any gain? I might as well not bother!~
@425  = ~The correct method is the one that works for you. (One. Two. Three.)~
@426  = ~Fourfivesixseveneightnineten. Wonderful. Most refreshing. And now I'm going to sleep.~
@427  = ~Human. I attempted that silly breath-counting of yours in private.~
@428  = ~And how was it?~
@429  = ~An absolute waste of time, as expected.~
@430  = ~I am sorry to hear that.~
@431  = ~Well?~
@432  = ~Is that all? You sing its praises one minute and don't even bother to defend it the next?~
@433  = ~I am not trying to compete with you, Flara. I suggested the exercise because I believed it could help you, not to prove a point. If you found it unrewarding, I apologise.~
@434  = ~It's just...it's not possible. One can't just disengage the mind. Every time I come close to ten, some other thought distracts me.~
@435  = ~Ah. Then you made it your goal to reach ten. That is not the intent.~
@436  = ~At one or a thousand, it matters only that you are counting.~
@437  = ~I can almost admire such tireless pursuit of restitution. That being said, STOP SCREAMING.~
@438  = ~I got an idea for your pits, Baeloth.~
@439  = ~The capacity for creative thought! Good for you. Unfortunately, I don't take suggestions, requests or opinions.~
@440  = ~Well that don't matter much, 'cause this is an order. Get gnolls.~
@441  = ~Gnolls?~
@442  = ~Gnolls. All gnolls, all the time. You'll call 'em the Gnoll Pits. Just a load of gnolls killing each other non-stop, till there ain't none left.~
@443  = ~That sounds tremendously tedious.~
@444  = ~You'll want to think about it. 'Cause until you say no, I got one reason not to nail your miserable slave trading arse to a tree.~
@445  = ~I will never understand why <CHARNAME> babysits the smallfolk. You are weak.~
@446  = ~Take a few hundred paces back and say that again.~
@447  = ~Yes, your coward's toy is all you have to offer. That is exactly my point.~
@448  = ~Alright. You want to talk about toys? Hand me yours and we'll see how you do against a giant.~
@449  = ~This is no toy, halfling.~
@450  = ~Who says? Swords, crossbows, it's all toys, yeah? So let's you and me just go on our way and <CHARNAME> can find a party of dragons. They don't need no toys.~
@451  = ~A good suggestion.~
@452  = ~There's always someone bigger, mate. The smaller you are, the quicker you learn to make the best of it.~
@453  = ~A fine shot, halfling. How fortunate that true warriors such as myself take the vanguard, giving you room to make such fine shots.~
@454  = ~Yes, Dorn. That's called tactics. *If* I have to draw steel and hack some legs off, I will. If.~
@455  = ~I should like to see that. Beware, however, for our enemies need only place a finger on your forehead to keep you at bay.~
@456  = ~You're a real sodding headcase, you know that?~
@457  = ~I ain't said one word about you and you still come down here flexing your shoulders and playing hard. Are you on the pull? You fancy a snog? 'Cause I wouldn't say no. Least it'd shut you up for a minute.~
@458  = ~The day I embrace one as feeble as you...~
@459  = ~It'll be the first bit of crumpet you've ever had in your life?~
@460  = ~It would be, wouldn't it? And you're gonna blame the orc blood, but it ain't that. Tusks aside. Big, strapping bloke. Strong jaw. You should have girls scaling your mail for a tongue wrestle. You know why you don't?~
@461  = ~'CAUSE YOU'RE A COMPLETE ARSE.~
@462  = ~Here's what to do, Dorn. Take your attitude, your accusations, your sword and your "patron", roll 'em up in a ball and STICK IT UP YOUR-~
@463  = ~The moment her morals clash with your orders, she will abandon you.~
@464  = ~It's a shame you weren't a wild elf, you know. They respect magic in the blood more than in the brain.~
@465  = ~Oh. So what, because I'm a wild mage, I don't have brains? I didn't have to study?~
@466  = ~I never said that. But your spells still go haywire, yeah? If it ain't 'cause you're casting 'em wrong, there must be something in you making it happen. They'd have spotted that, right off. Would have had you work on it instead of burying it under a pile of books.~
@467  = ~Yeah yeah, elves are so smart and wonderful and they could have fixed all my problems if ONLY I'd been blessed with their gloriously pure blood. Too bad I'm just some half-breed, huh? ~
@468  = ~You like being a victim, don't you?~
@469  = ~I had to learn to like it!~
@470  = ~What's High Forest like? I'd love to go there one day.~
@471  = ~How do you know?~
@472  = ~You just asked me what it's like, which means you don't know. So how do you know you'd love to go there?~
@473  = ~Well...'cause I've heard stories. "It's the last of the old forests, and one of the last places the elves can call home."~
@474  = ~So you do know what it's like, then?~
@475  = ~No, 'cause I ain't sure if they're true or not. Sometimes stories are just stories.~
@476  = ~Well which is it? Do you believe the stories and want to go, or do you not and you aren't sure?~
@477  = ~Look, don't be a pain in the arse. You know what I mean.~
@478  = ~No! No, I don't know! I think you just heard "forest with elves" and assumed it must be great!~
@479  = ~Well that's why I'm asking you, then! You've lived there!~
@480  = ~YOU ARE SHALLOW! SHALLOW AND FALSE AND WRETCHED!~
@481  = ~I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE!~
@482  = ~It's alright.~
@483  = ~Nice trees.~
@484  = ~Littlun, do you ever feel that your weapon makes combat too simple?~
@485  = ~Yeah, heard it all before. "Oh, it's just a poor man's longbow. Oh, it's a peasant's weapon, anyone can use 'em." All from people who've never touched one in their life.~
@486  = ~Here. Try it. See how simple it is. ~
@487  = ~Littlun-~
@488  = ~Or what if it broke, eh? How would you fix it? Let's say this bit here starts wearing down. What do you do?~
@489  = ~I do not mean to say it requires no skill. But to have the act of killing reduced to the flick of a finger...~
@490  = ~Bollocks. It ain't about what it is, it's about who holds it. You give a murderer an apple tart and they'll find a way. Give a decent person a weapon, any weapon, they'll find a way not to.~
@491  = ~Rasaad. This monk who took you and your brother in. You hadn't met him before?~
@492  = ~I would remember if I had. Even before I was initiated, I could sense something different in him, the way he carried himself.~
@493  = ~And you're sure he weren't related? A friend of the family? Anyone who might think they owed you?~
@494  = ~I am certain. He was a man who caught our hands in his pockets. Nothing more. Why do you ask?~
@495  = ~'Cause if strangers' kindness saves two people, and the world's small enough that they meet, you start thinking it ain't a fluke.~
@496  = ~There is more good in man's heart than the cynical will admit.~
@497  = ~The Sun Soul teaches that we must always remember what we are capable of. It is a warning that anyone may wreak great cruelty, and a reminder that anyone may show great charity. We must be mindful of both, like the new moon and the full.~
@498  = ~It's easy to forget sometimes.~
@499  = ~It is. But for us, who have experienced true generosity, it is also easy to remember.~
@500  = ~"Revenge is beneath you"? Five minutes ago I met this sod, and I already know that's the daftest thing anyone's ever said about him.~
@501  = ~Now here's a fine contender.~
@502  = ~Strong. Silent. Subservient. The helmet lends an aura of mystique, and you'd be too far from the spectators to offend them with your...other aura.~
@503  = ~You simply must participate in my arena once I'm reinstated. And I do mean must.~
@504  = ~I don't fight in pits.~
@505  = ~No no. You mean you don't *want* to fight in pits. You'd be amazed how little that matters.~
@506  = ~I do not fight in pits. Cage me, beat me, kill me if you want. You will never make me lift a shield without a reason behind it.~
@507  = ~Your survival is the reason!~
@508  = ~Hah.~
@509  = ~There is a certain saying about the best defence, dwarf.~
@510  = ~Coined by someone who never learned to take hits.~
@511  = ~I find those who question my endurance often lack it themselves.~
@512  = ~Not questioning anything. But there's more to it than size and stubbornness.~
@513  = ~Someone swings, you move with it. Let the armour take the brunt, but make them think they're hurting you. They believe they're winning, they'll swing harder. Wilder.~
@514  = ~When their arm gets heavy, they'll catch on. But then they're yours.~
@515  = ~Hmm.~
@516  = ~Mind you, that's for ending fights. You prefer starting them, looks like.~
@517  = ~You are a parasite.~
@518  = ~Huh. Been called lots of things, but never that. Did you mean I *have* parasites?~
@519  = ~I joined with <CHARNAME> to further my agenda. You...~
@520  = ~Took a job.~
@521  = ~Perhaps that is what you call it. In truth, you have latched on to <PRO_HIMHER>, adopted a cause that means nothing to you, because you lack one of your own.~
@522  = ~You have no drive. No appetite. You strike with muscle and nothing else. That is why you cannot defeat me.~
@523  = ~Was that an issue for anyone besides you?~
@524  = ~You said it yourself, dwarf. I prefer to start the fight.~
@525  = ~And I prefer to end it.~
@526  = ~Been ten minutes. Time for Dorn to remind us he doesn't trust anyone.~
@527  = ~Mercenaries turn their coats at the first sign of a better offer.~
@528  = ~I know sod all about magic, so bear with me. These surges...~
@529  = ~*sigh*~
@530  = ~The short of it is, every spell you cast could hurt someone you weren't aiming at.~
@531  = ~I am so, so sick of having this conversation. Aren't there other things to talk about? Like the weather? Hasn't it been nice lately?~
@532  = ~Is that a yes?~
@533  = ~Yes. Alright? It's a yes. I'm a walking maelstrom of destruction and none of you are safe. Happy?~
@534  = ~See, that puts me in an awkward spot. If your magic ever threatens <CHARNAME>, I'm obligated to kill you.~
@535  = ~Nothing personal. Just letting you know.~
@536  = ~<CHARNAME>? Can we talk about your dwarf, please?~
@537  = ~You complain about my magic, but any fight is unpredictable, isn't it? Especially for you, out in the thick of it. No peripheral vision either. It must be hard to tell who's who sometimes.~
@538  = ~Yeah.~
@539  = ~So if you swung your hammer and accidentally hit <CHARNAME>...?~
@540  = ~I'd have to kill myself.~
@541  = ~You're kidding. Right?~
@542  = ~Dunno.~
@543  = ~Are you religious at all, Moidre?~
@544  = ~By your standards? Probably not.~
@545  = ~One can have faith without devoting one's life to it, my friend. But then, I know little of the dwarven gods. Would you be willing to shed some light?~
@546  = ~Well, there's Moradin. He's in charge. Berronar Truesilver, goddess of oaths and loyalty. Gorm Gulthyn, god of defence and vigilance.~
@547  = ~Uh, who else. Dumathoin...~
@548  = ~Forgive me, but you speak of them so distantly. Are there none closer to your heart?~
@549  = ~Time and again, I'll say a prayer in my head to whoever might be listening. Don't go much further than that.~
@550  = ~You feel that they have nothing to offer you?~
@551  = ~More that I've got nothing to offer them.~
@552  = ~So you're a Sun Soul. Not sure I see the difference between that and an everyday Selunite.~
@553  = ~It is not as great as you may think. While some deepen their connection to Selune by travelling the world, doing good works in her name, we adopt a discipline of training and introspection to attain our ideal selves, and to help others attain theirs.~
@554  = ~But though our methods may differ, our goals align. In our own ways, we seek only to bring the Moonmaiden's light to those who are trapped in darkness.~
@555  = ~Sounds nice.~
@556  = ~It is a fulfilling path. Perhaps I might encourage you to walk it yourself.~
@557  = ~No. A lot of faiths *sound* nice. Still haven't settled on one, so it takes more than that.~
@558  = ~What would it take?~
@559  = ~Not sure yet.~
@560  = ~I will press no further, then. This decision is one you must make for yourself. But know that none who would embrace Selune are turned away.~
@561  = ~Best they'll do is scratch the shield. Hope you're not counting on them.~
@562  = ~The last time it happened, I got five coppers and a chunk of obsidian. An ugly chunk.~
@563  = ~Ah. Then my...curiosity is sated.~
@564  = ~Yeah, I was disappointed too.~
@565  = ~Woe is me, for I am denied my true draconic form, trapped within this frail human shell! I struggle and struggle, yet there is naught to be done! Will no one save me from this torment?~
@566  = ~Take heart, fair dragoness, for your plight has been heard by Sandrah! Child and heir of the great Elminster, who may call himself the most powerful man in Faerun only for that I was born a woman! Behold as I shatter thy foul curse with but a wave of my mighty hand!~
@567  = ~Oh, Sandrah! Praise be to thee! I am cured! My entire subplot resolved singlehandedly by your unrivalled, all-eclipsing splendour! How can I ever repay your kindness, not just in what you have done for me, but for merely existing in all your angelic perfection? What service could I possibly render to a being possessed of such awesome power, yet such graceful humility?~
@568  = ~Do me.~
@569  = ~As you wish. Hop in, pipsqueak. Mind the teeth.~
@570  = ~*gazes sexily*~
@571  = ~*smiles bashfully*~
@572  = ~*approaches seductively*~
@573  = ~*fondles hornily*~
@574  = ~*frenches slurpily*~
@575  = ~Wait. Don't you think we're moving too fast?~
@576  = ~Maybe we should warm things up with, I dunno, some character development, a few jokes...~
@577  = ~*FRENCHES SLURPILY*~
@578  = ~Mmf! We havent even done the falling-out and making up bit yet! Thats an essential part of these early Bioware romanc-~
@579  = ~***SLOOOOOORP***~
@580  = ~Moidre...so many in this group are repulsed by your dwarven musk...personally I find it quite...bewitching...~
@581  = ~Take afreakin sniff babbe~
@582  = ~Perhaps I could be the first...to get you out of that heavy armour...~
@583  = ~Yeah gurl you like that dont, you. Yu like that belly hair?? Wanna to get a fork and twirl it like spaghetti~ [GAM_17A]
@584  = ~Only if you show me the meatballs...~
@585  = ~pull my beard~
@586  = ~HArder you pussy~
@587  = ~Hey, Sandrah. I know youre no Talassan, but I bet you and I could still make sparks fly.~
@588  = ~Eh...~
@589  = ~How about I swing by tonight and help you, ah, polish your symbol?~
@590  = ~No thanks.~
@591  = ~Pardon?~
@592  = ~You're not really my type.~
@593  = ~But...~
@594  = ~Im sorry, just what in the hell are you talking about? Your *type*? You dont have a type! You sleep with everyone! Race, gender, alignment, none of it matters! Safana *wishes* she got as much action as you!~
@595  = ~I really dont. Even I know when to close shop.~
@596  = ~And I want this! I actually want this! Im barely even acting out of character right now! I am literally the only one in this mod who would sleep with you if you asked me!~
@597  = ~OOC behaviour is my kink. Your consistent personality got me drier than the Anauroch. Come back when youre gay so I can straighten you out again, my friend.~
@598  = ~Agh! Friendzoned...not again! I can't take it again!~
@599  = ~So how's things in the Helmite church?~
@600  = ~...fine.~
@601  = ~I always thought it must be stifling, representing a god like that. All that discipline and strictness. Like being in the army, except you don't get any time off.~
@602  = ~Evil does not take time off.~
@603  = ~*Some* of us do.~
@604  = ~It's just, um. You don't seem to have much of a life. I'm not sure how else to phrase that.~
@605  = ~My honour is my life.~
@606  = ~Right. I'm sure that's what you say around the other knights, but you're not my squire. You don't have to impress me.~
@607  = ~I assure you, that is not my intent.~
@608  = ~Ajantis! I've got some cards here if you fancy a game. I lost the Knave of Hearts somewhere, but...~
@609  = ~I will not partake in gambling. Nor do I condone it.~
@610  = ~Neither will I. I'd go broke. It's just for fun.~
@611  = ~Very well, but I fear I don't know how to play. Perhaps someone else will-~
@612  = ~I can teach you. It's not that complicated.~
@613  = ~...I'd honestly prefer not to.~
@614  = ~Wait, do you really not know any card games? At all?~
@615  = ~I must keep my vigil. Excuse me.~
@616  = ~Do you understand the danger of invoking a god falsely? Especially one as wrathful as Talos. He will not brook pretences of faith.~
@617  = ~Um, yes? No pretence here. I'm the real thing. Got the symbol and everything, look.~
@618  = ~But you don't behave like a Talassan at all. If this is some silly game you're playing...~
@619  = ~Have you met any Talassans? As in, spoken to them? Learned their names?~
@620  = ~I...~
@621  = ~Do you remember what *my* name is? Or am I just "that priest of Talos"?~
@622  = ~It's...it doesn't matter. I do not need to know a man's name to know his deeds, or to bring him to justice. That is my duty and I won't be talked down from it.~
@623  = ~I'm not trying to. I'm saying maybe you should get to know us first.~
@624  = ~See, killing a Talassan is easy for you. Same way killing a Helmite is easy for us. But killing Joe Such-and-Such, who it turns out grew up in same town as you and makes wood carvings on his days off and still misses his mum sometimes...that's not easy. Not for anyone.~
@625  = ~If you can do that in the name of your god, then you can really call yourself a paladin. Or a priest. Or whatever it is you're trying to be.~
@626  = ~It's Dave, by the way. Nice to meet you.~
@627  = ~Hee hee. It's so cute how you carved your name in this.~
@628  = ~In what?~
@629  = ~Is that my holy symbol?!~
@630  = ~Is it? Which hand? This hand? Orrr maybe this one?~
@631  = ~No no no, don't do this. Please give it back. I'll get electrocuted. You'll get electrocuted. Someone's getting a lightning bolt soon. Please.~
@632  = ~Have you ever been to jail, Alora?~
@633  = ~Oh, a few times. I never stay long. The food's just awful. ~
@634  = ~I was wondering if you had any tips on getting out. Just in case.~
@635  = ~For you? But you're so nice! Who'd want to put you in jail?~
@636  = ~Um, loads of people. I'm a Talassan. Destroying villages and killing innocents doesn't endear you to the general populace.~
@637  = ~Sure, but you never actually *do* any of that stuff.~
@638  = ~Well...~
@639  = ~Do you?~
@640  = ~...no.~
@641  = ~So. Branwen. I don't get to meet a lot of priestesses in this business.~
@642  = ~Er, not that Talos doesn't accept women. It's just, I don't get to meet a lot of priests at all, and then of the few, only half are female, so-~
@643  = ~Build some muscle, put a new symbol around your neck and come back in five years. Then we'll see.~
@644  = ~Oh. You don't care for Talos?~
@645  = ~Or his scrawny priests.~
@646  = ~Hey, I've been told I'm...of an above average build. Once.~
@647  = ~By your mother.~
@648  = ~Just because my mother said it doesn't mean it's not true.~
@649  = ~I just think we have so much in common. Battle, destruction, rebellion...~
@650  = ~Don't dare, boy. Tempus' domain is war. An even contest where all may prove themselves worthy. He is not a god of wanton slaughter and plunder.~
@651  = ~But that sort of thing always happens in war.~
@652  = ~Tempus does not condone it.~
@653  = ~But it still happens. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean you aren't responsible.~
@654  = ~And so you would condemn me? You, a priest of Talos?~
@655  = ~Er, no. I'm all for it. Like I said, it's something we have in common.~
@656  = ~A Talassan's praise IS condemnation. Now go away.~
@657  = ~I really think we were getting somewhere with that discussion...~
@658  = ~Go.~
@659  = ~I just don't understand people sometimes, Coran. When you steal, everyone acts like it's all a bit of cheeky fun. When we steal, it's dead or alive bounties a thousand leagues in every direction. What's the difference?~
@660  = ~Ah, Dave. You've overdistanced yourself from the hearts of common folk. Each and every one, whether they admit it or not, harbours a wish to see wealthy men brought down a peg. Just a peg, mind; 'tis not spite, only discontent.~
@661  = ~The difference, as you inquired, is who and what. A wicked man leaves his victims destitute, while I take from the rich and the rich alone, and never more than they can spare.~
@662  = ~How do you know what they can spare? They could have a sick relative and be saving up for some expensive medicine. They could be building an orphanage. In fact, maybe someone was going to sponsor an investigation in the mines before you swiped their funds.~
@663  = ~One can't live life hindered by maybes and mights, my friend. And you surely aren't suggesting that the Talassans haven't done worse?~
@664  = ~Not while calling ourselves heroes.~
@665  = ~Are you sure you wouldn't like to join the church, Coran? We can always use people with your skills.~
@666  = ~Is that so? I wouldn't have thought raiding and wrecking called for a nimble touch. Then again, I'm not in the business.~
@667  = ~Oh, no. If something's locked, we smash it open. I'm talking about your mental skills.~
@668  = ~First you rationalised stealing. Now you leave your daughter fatherless without even hesitating. At this rate, you could easily hold a halo in one hand and a symbol of Talos in the other. That's why we need you.~
@669  = ~People like me are just rank and file. It's the priests who delude themselves, who honestly think everything they're doing is right...they're the ones who leave their mark.~
@670  = ~Why, Dave. Do I detect a hint of aggression?~
@671  = ~Even the worst gods don't like hypocrisy.~
@672  = ~Art thou avoiding me, Dave?~
@673  = ~No! I mean, yes, but it's not you. It's...you know.~
@674  = ~Alas, no.~
@675  = ~Minsc. He's supposed to protect you, and he knows I'm a Talassan. I feel like I'm about to get bull tackled any second just talking to you.~
@676  = ~'Tis not impossible, I admit. Perhaps not even unlikely.~
@677  = ~...right. So I'll just leave you to it.~
@678  = ~Wouldst thou be so kind as to carry my pack awhile?~
@679  = ~Um. I would, but mine's pretty heavy already and-~
@680  = ~What are you doing to Dynaheir?!~
@681  = ~Nothing! I was just...I was...~
@682  = ~Calm thyself, Minsc. 'Twas only his wish to lighten my load.~
@683  = ~Is that not so, Dave?~
@684  = ~Right. Exactly.~
@685  = ~Would it be rude to ask what I did to deserve this?~
@686  = ~No, but the question is better directed to thy god.~
@687  = ~I meant what did I do to *you*. Whatever I may or may not have done as a Talassan, I don't see why you have it in for me personally.~
@688  = ~It strikes thee as unjust, then?~
@689  = ~Oh. You're trying to teach me a lesson.~
@690  = ~Except I'm not sure what you want me to learn. That Talos isn't nice? Already figured that one out.~
@691  = ~Perhaps I'm merely punishing a wayward child.~
@692  = ~Ugh. If you want to stand in for my mum, you'd better make really good gingerbread.~
@693  = ~How's Thay handling Bane's disappearance? I heard he was quite popular over there.~
@694  = ~We march on, naturally. A true Thayvian does not place himself in the gods. He acknowledges them, gives them their dues, and that is all. Unlike certain backwards nations.~
@695  = ~Rashemen.~
@696  = ~Precisely.~
@697  = ~But the only people in Thay with any real power are the wizards, right? And without the gods, without Mystra, there wouldn't be any magic. So in a sense-~
@698  = ~This argument has been made countless times, and it's no less flawed for the repetition.~
@699  = ~Air is here, and we breathe it. That does not make us Akadians. Vegetation is here, and we consume it. That does not make us Chaunteans.~
@700  = ~Magic is here, and we wield it. That does not make us Mystrans.~
@701  = ~You know about Mystryl, right Edwin?~
@702  = ~More so than you, no doubt.~
@703  = ~And you know she died and came back as Mystra. But while she was gone, all the magic in the world stopped working.~
@704  = ~Is it too much to hope you have a point? ~
@705  = ~Well, let's say Chauntea died. That wouldn't make all the farms in the world disappear. Or Akadi. If she died, we wouldn't all suffocate.~
@706  = ~Because they're the gods *of* whatever, but they're not actually the whatever. Mystra's different. She's not just the god of magic, she actually is magic. She's the Weave embodied.~
@707  = ~So it's not really the same thing. Q.E.B.~
@708  = ~Dave, you could spend years writing a full dissertation, its every page bursting with profundity, and it still wouldn't make "It's not really the same thing" a worthwhile thesis.~
@709  = ~And it's Q.E.D., fool.~
@710  = ~Hey, I know that song! That's a Talassan hymn!~
@711  = ~Ah? I suppose I should have guessed. One too many overwrought storm metaphors. But a decent piece it is, despite its faults.~
@712  = ~We do like our music to have some punch to it. I can't stand those droning chants some churches have. Those are awful.~
@713  = ~Oh, oh, listen to this one. This is one of my favourites.~
@714  = ~No thank you.~
@715  = ~Thunder!~
@716  = ~Aa-AA-aa-AAAA-AA-a-AAAA-Aah.~
@717  = ~THUNDER!~
@718  = ~Riveting. Not to call you single-minded, but-~
@719  = ~THUN-DER!~
@720  = ~Hold on, it doesn't work without the backing music. Lend me the lute a minute.~
@721  = ~I'd sooner lend you my liver.~
@722  = ~The world's a funny place, Eldoth.~
@723  = ~In many ways. Dare I ask which one tickles your brain today?~
@724  = ~I'm just thinking, you've got your whole plan with Skie. Holding her "hostage" for the money. That's not a nice thing to do, but nobody's getting hurt. Her rich dad's a bit less rich and that's it.~
@725  = ~How very true. Would that you made the laws, my friend.~
@726  = ~Now if it were me, I'd call down a storm to wreck the estate, kill the survivors, and pick the valuables out of the rubble. That's far worse. Much more harm done.~
@727  = ~Indeed.~
@728  = ~And yet everybody thinks *you're* the scumbag.~
@729  = ~Not me! I actually think it's very clever. Just in general. I've noticed. People sort of give you that look.~
@730  = ~Yes. Quite.~
@731  = ~So let's say a lightning bolt hits a tree, starts a fire and burns down the forest.~
@732  = ~Um. Do you get angry at the storm, or what? Because that's a natural...thing. Not anybody's fault.~
@733  = ~Yes. If it happens naturally, it is meant to be.~
@734  = ~But I don't understand. If someone cuts down one tree, just one, even if they replant it, you'll kill them. But if a wildfire destroys the entire forest, burns all the animals alive, and nobody gets to use the wood afterwards...~
@735  = ~Then it is natural.~
@736  = ~...and that's just better. No matter what.~
@737  = ~Yes! It's perfectly simple!~
@738  = ~It really isn't, Faldorn.~
@739  = ~Have you ever met a dryad, Faldorn? Or a nymph? Anything like that?~
@740  = ~I will not play matchmaker with the fey for you.~
@741  = ~I...what? That's not what I was going to say.~
@742  = ~Yes it was.~
@743  = ~Alright, I was thinking it. But I wasn't going to ask, because I knew you'd say no.~
@744  = ~My point is, they don't murder people for walking through the forest in the wrong shoes, and you can't say they aren't in tune with nature. So-~
@745  = ~Which is why they need us.~
@746  = ~I'm asking if you think they'd encourage it.~
@747  = ~A mother does not ask her children's permission to protect them.~
@748  = ~Good show, Garrick. You sure know how to work the classics. I don't think anyone's ever played it like that before.~
@749  = ~Sir, my style may disagree with you, but there are those in the party who do appreciate it. There is no call for mockery.~
@750  = ~I'm not mocking you! I really mean it. The way you put your own spin on these songs, it feels like I'm hearing them for the first time again.~
@751  = ~Truly? Er...my thanks, then, and pardon my leery manner. 'Tis quite the surprise to find a taste for music among Talos' clergy.~
@752  = ~Nobody expects priests to care for anything besides what their god cares about. Strange, that. You hang a symbol around your neck, cast a few healing spells, and everyone suddenly forgets you're a person.~
@753  = ~...and that is what separates a bard from a mere entertainer. Improvisation in place of rote memorisation. Inspiration, never stagnation.~
@754  = ~Wow. There's a lot more to this barding business than I thought.~
@755  = ~Oh, it all becomes second nature with the proper education. I studied in Berdusk, you know.~
@756  = ~Mm. That reminds me. How come you mention Berdusk so often?~
@757  = ~Do I? I'm quite sure that's the first time.~
@758  = ~It's not. "I studied at the college in BERDUSK." It's like a mantra. What's so special about it? Is it famous for music?~
@759  = ~Yes. Of course it is. You obviously know that or you wouldn't have said it.~
@760  = ~Well, no. I figured it out because you're a bard and you keep bringing it up. But if I'd never met you before, and you said "I was taught in Berdusk," I wouldn't go "Oh, so you're a musician?"~
@761  = ~Maybe it's not *that* famous. Is what I'm saying.~
@762  = ~Perhaps not to the common person, but among fellow artists...~
@763  = ~But I'm not a fellow artist.~
@764  = ~How come you mention Berdusk so often?~
@765  = ~Well, I...I did study there, you know.~
@766  = ~Yes. I do.~
@767  = ~(Alright Talos I know I'm not supposed to do this but PLEASE Sune help me out.)~
@768  = ~Hey Imoen!~
@769  = ~Hi?~
@770  = ~You must be the greatest thief in the world, because-~
@771  = ~I've stolen your heart?~
@772  = ~ Y...no. No. I was just going to say you're good at what you do. I think you really benefit the group.~
@773  = ~Oh. That's a shame, 'cause that would've been a great line.~
@774  = ~Alright, I'll be honest. That's exactly what I was going to say.~
@775  = ~Psh, sure it was. Thanks, Dave. Glad to hear I'm just an asset.~
@776  = ~Can I buy you a drink, Imoen? I'm not sure if you drink yet or not. I don't, but...~
@777  = ~A drink? You wanna buy me a drink?~
@778  = ~But you don't drink.~
@779  = ~Er. Right.~
@780  = ~So you're trying to get me drunk.~
@781  = ~No! Just *a* drink. One drink.~
@782  = ~Skinflint!~
@783  = ~Or some food. Anything. I would like us to sit at a table together and consume something. Or nothing. We could just...~
@784  = ~Are you doing this on purpose?~
@785  = ~Doing what?~
@786  = ~Dave, listen. You're alright.~
@787  = ~I am?~
@788  = ~Yep. You've got a real nice smile and you're just dumb enough to be funny.~
@789  = ~And you're a Talassan. So...no.~
@790  = ~Story of my life.~
@791  = ~It doesn't have to be.~
@792  = ~...what's that supposed to mean?~
@793  = ~You don't have to be a Talassan. You could give it up.~
@794  = ~Give it up? Just for a chance with you? That's going a bit far, isn't it?~
@795  = ~Not happening, huh? Guess you were never that interested to begin with, then.~
@796  = ~Well, yes. Obviously. Gods, Imoen. I think you're smart and pretty and I wanted to spend some time with you. That's it. I wasn't waving a ring in your face.~
@797  = ~Whatever. Maybe I can find myself a nice Aurilite girl.~
@798  = ~You'd be warmer sleeping alone.~
@799  = ~I can handle the cold. The question is, can she handle the heat?~
@800  = ~Hah, I'm using that. That's brilliant.~
@801  = ~Would you like a parchment, Jaheira?~
@802  = ~No, but I would like you to stop your foolishness. You are not a Talassan, child. End this facade before someone is hurt.~
@803  = ~Heh. I get told I'm not really a Talassan a lot, and, uh...I don't know where people think I get the spells from, then. I'm not nearly smart enough to be a wizard.~
@804  = ~Magic is not the mark of a true worshipper. Gods like him will grant power to anyone who serves their purposes.~
@805  = ~He uses you, and you accept what he gives in return. It is nothing more than that.~
@806  = ~But that's exactly what Talos wants. People to use. Servants.~
@807  = ~Then you admit you are not devoted to him.~
@808  = ~Well...yes, in the sense that you've created your own idea of devotion and decided it doesn't apply to me.~
@809  = ~You might be right if you were talking about some other god, but Talos isn't interested in my personality. He wants to be feared, he wants destruction, so he gives people the power to make it happen. So yes, I am a Talassan, because that's what a Talassan is.~
@810  = ~What do druids have against Talos, exactly? Storms are part of nature, aren't they? ~
@811  = ~You're always going on about the balance, how there have to be two sides to everything, but when someone stands for the side you don't like, you get all huffy about it.~
@812  = ~Don't sass your elders, young man.~
@813  = ~That's what old people say when a young person stumps them.~
@814  = ~Not...not that you're old. Older. Older people.~
@815  = ~...you know, you can glare at me all you want, and it is really scary, but it's not much of an argument.~
@816  = ~Look upon this forest, Dave, and tell me what you see.~
@817  = ~Um. Trees. Grass. ~
@818  = ~Life. At its purest, at its least destructive.~
@819  = ~All life must feed. Some on plants, some on meat. Some on both, like you or me. But this life before you needs only sun and water.~
@820  = ~There is beauty in that which does not thrive on death.~
@821  = ~BUT, flowers grow prettiest in graveyards. Huh? Huh?~
@822  = ~...wow. I just said that off the cuff, but that was quite deep, wasn't it?~
@823  = ~Only to someone dipping their toes for the first time.~
@824  = ~Let me guess. Vergadain?~
@825  = ~Eh?~
@826  = ~Dwarven god of wealth? Commerce?~
@827  = ~I know who he is, idiot. Why'd you bring him up?~
@828  = ~Well...I assumed you were a follower.~
@829  = ~Huh. Why not? He seems like a good fit.~
@830  = ~What, just 'cause I wanna be rich means I have to worship the money god? You think I'm that simple?~
@831  = ~No, wait. I'm stupid. It's Abbathor, right? God of greed?~
@832  = ~Hah! I knew it.~
@833  = ~Ah, shut your trap.~
@834  = ~So how come you're not a cleric, Kagain? Of Abbathor, I mean.~
@835  = ~Shut up with that, will you? I don't need it advertised.~
@836  = ~Why not? I advertise it. And no offence, but I don't think the "greedy git" god is as taboo as the "kill everything with lightning" god.~
@837  = ~Yeah, well. Other dwarves wouldn't agree.~
@838  = ~Is that why you left? Because humans were more tolerant?~
@839  = ~Because humans were more ignorant.~
@840  = ~How do you know so much about Abbathor in the first place? Gives me the creeps. I've met dwarves who know less.~
@841  = ~Oh, I know all the evil gods, A-Z. Or...Abbathor to Zinzerena, heh.~
@842  = ~Why? Someone drop you on an encyclopedia as a baby?~
@843  = ~I didn't want to pick one at random, you know? I did a lot of research before I settled on Talos.~
@844  = ~I was considering Cyric at first, but...ergh. Too mental for me.~
@845  = ~So you just up and decide to worship an "evil" god one day. Not any particular one. Not because you felt something inside. Just for the sake of it.~
@846  = ~More or less.~
@847  = ~The hell's wrong with you, boy?~
@848  = ~Eh. You're only young once.~
@849  = ~Am I making you nervous?~
@850  = ~M-me? No. I've always had a bit of a s-stutter, I'm afraid.~
@851  = ~Oh. Part of me hoped I was, honestly. It'd be the first time anyone was scared of me.~
@852  = ~Would it? Not to be rude, b-but I've noticed people shying away.~
@853  = ~Nah, it's the symbol that worries them. Talos. If I took it off, nobody would look twice.~
@854  = ~Perhaps you've chosen the wrong vocation, then?~
@855  = ~Well if I did, so did you. Would anyone be scared of you if you didn't have a sword?~
@856  = ~I suppose you have me there.~
@857  = ~I wish I was a half-elf.~
@858  = ~Not a full elf. Too different, I think. Just a long-lived human who can see in the dark. That'd be perfect.~
@859  = ~It's anything but perfect, Dave. When you're not quite one race and not quite the other, it...it can be difficult to find acceptance from either.~
@860  = ~You think I'd be worshipping a violent storm god if I was looking for acceptance?~
@861  = ~Ah...~
@862  = ~Then again, we are one of the most tolerant bunches you'll find. Maybe you should think about joining?~
@863  = ~Tolerant? Dave, the Talassans kill people. They s-sow destruction for destruction's sake.~
@864  = ~True. But I promise you, whether you're a prospective member or an infidel to be smote, the last thing we care about is the shape of your ears.~
@865  = ~I'd just like to say I'm not a bandit.~
@866  = ~I know.~
@867  = ~And yet you're still giving me devil eyes.~
@868  = ~Would a Talassan not have done what they did?~
@869  = ~Uh, probably not.~
@870  = ~No, really! That doesn't sound like us. We prefer to think big. Something that gets everyone talking. Kidnapping a couple of elves on holiday? Who'd even know?~
@871  = ~I actually think that's a bit stupid. What's the point of torturing people if you don't want anything from them? Unless they were Loviatans...~
@872  = ~They wanted screams. That was the point. "Entertainment."~
@873  = ~When I want entertainment, I go and see a play. So we should be fine.~
@874  = ~How old are you, Kivan?~
@875  = ~I'm trying to do some sums. I think I just realised something.~
@876  = ~Alright, let's say you're 180. Sorry if I'm overestimating, but it's hard to tell and you aren't being very cooperative. All being well, you'll live another 600 years? Roughly? Alright then.~
@877  = ~Now, about Deh...Dairy...~
@878  = ~You will not speak her name.~
@879  = ~I don't think I *can* speak her name. Anyway, elves are at "that age" around 120, so I'll assume you met her then. Again, I'm being generous here.~
@880  = ~You plan to spend the next six hundred years of your life dwelling on the past sixty. Which would mean letting that relationship affect you for ten times as long as it actually lasted.~
@881  = ~That's what teenage humans do when their first crush gets bored of them, Kivan. Are you sure you want to join us?~
@882  = ~Deheriana did not tire of me. She is GONE, Talassan. She is DEAD.~
@883  = ~Gone to elf heaven, where she's perfectly happy. Nobody can hurt her anymore, so why do you feel bad? Because you miss her. What's the difference?~
@884  = ~Kill Tazok if that's what you want, but gods. Let the angst go with him.~
@885  = ~Stop there! Boo knows that symbol! You serve an enemy of the Three!~
@886  = ~Three...?~
@887  = ~Oh, the goddesses. Mielikki and...oh boy. I knew this was coming.~
@888  = ~Evil, meet my sword! Sword, meet-!~
@889  = ~Wait!~
@890  = ~Wait. Just wait. Uh...~
@891  = ~What if I don't worship Talos?~
@892  = ~Eh? But you wear the symbol.~
@893  = ~Right. But what if I didn't?~
@894  = ~Er.~
@895  = ~Dynaheir?~
@896  = ~Thou must ponder this alone, Minsc.~
@897  = ~Dynaheir? It is not for me to question the witches, but I wonder why you have needed so many heavy books lately. You have always said it's best to travel light.~
@898  = ~Indeed, and I am glad thou hast remembered. Let us say...this is a special case.~
@899  = ~Ah.~
@900  = ~Forgive me, but I also wonder why you have little Dave carry them for you. Is Minsc not better suited?~
@901  = ~Hng...ggg...~
@902  = ~Even Boo may be better suited.~
@903  = ~No, Minsc. Thou must always be battle-ready. 'Twould not do to weigh thee down.~
@904  = ~(Better hope you don't need healing.)~
@905  = ~Didst thou address me, Dave?~
@906  = ~Better hope you don't need healing, *esteemed hathran.*~
@907  = ~Seriously, have you thought about that? Because it will be a problem.~
@908  = ~I have confidence thou wilt manage.~
@909  = ~How have you not killed Xzar yet? Really. I keep waking up in the morning and looking in his bedroll and no, he's still alive.~
@910  = ~We've people to answer to, is why, and there'd be questions asked if we went two and came back one.~
@911  = ~You could make it look like an accident, though. In fact, you wouldn't even have to. It's not as if any of us will run back to your masters and tattle.~
@912  = ~Come the days end, the use of his magic's outdone the chafe of his company. Much like yerself.~
@913  = ~Well. Thanks. I suppose I'd rather be useful and chafey than just chafey.~
@914  = ~To me, aye. Ye assuredly would.~
@915  = ~Now that I've thought about it, Xzar might not be beyond help.~
@916  = ~Ye've no thought hard, then.~
@917  = ~There are spells that can cure madness. I might even be powerful enough to use them myself one day. We could fix him.~
@918  = ~Oh. "We" now, is it?~
@919  = ~Let me tell ye why "we" will no be doing that. This here mayhap be the savviest necromancer on the coast. I seen him tell a pile of bones to pull itself together, and it did. I seen him peel a man's skin and make it slither.~
@920  = ~So often he'll sit up in the night, blank and stiff as dead. He'll fix his eyes and whisper he'll own us all one day, we'll all be his corpse-puppets, and it's the only thing in the world's ever robbed me of sleep.~
@921  = ~Yer proposal be to take this man, this unbelievably dangerous man, and set all his ducks in a row.~
@922  = ~...since you put it that way, maybe he's fine the way he is.~
@923  = ~I can't believe I just said that about Xzar.~
@924  = ~Nor could I.~
@925  = ~Where are you going, Quayle?~
@926  = ~Hmm?~
@927  = ~You said you were heading in a certain direction when we met, like you had a place in mind. But now you're just following us around.~
@928  = ~Ah, my dear boy. Once you're as old and wise as I am, you'll learn that the journey is what matters, not the destination.~
@929  = ~Relatively speaking, of course. A human couldn't possibly be as old or wise as me.~
@930  = ~Right, but for that to work, there has to actually be a destination. Otherwise there's no journey either. Just meandering.~
@931  = ~And who's to say the destination is a physical place? ~
@932  = ~You're desperately, soul-crushingly lonely and took whatever company you could get.~
@933  = ~Don't answer. It'll be sad if you confirm it, and sadder if you deny it.~
@934  = ~I'm surprised you kept your word, Safana.~
@935  = ~At the cave. Remember? You said you'd split the treasure with us, but I was expecting you to grab it and run while we were busy with the golems.~
@936  = ~My my! How naughty you must think I am.~
@937  = ~And yet at the time, you never said a word. Why is that?~
@938  = ~Uh. I didn't want to be rude.~
@939  = ~You're a good boy, Dave.~
@940  = ~Thank you. I'm not supposed to be.~
@941  = ~It's awkward to ask, but are you ever going to do that routine of pretending to seduce me and then taking my stuff?~
@942  = ~...it rather lessens the thrill when the victim is expecting it.~
@943  = ~Or dare I say requesting?~
@944  = ~I get kind of lonely sometimes.~
@945  = ~Oh, very well. I suppose I can pinch a few valuables later this eve. If you're lucky, perhaps I'll pinch something else.~
@946  = ~Great! Oh, can it be tomorrow, though? I need to get some valuables first.~
@947  = ~Heh. Hahaha.~
@948  = ~Oh, nothing. I just thought of something funny.~
@949  = ~Are you mocking me?~
@950  = ~Uh...no. Really, it's just something that happened earlier. Popped into my head.~
@951  = ~I'll pop a blade into your head! Dung smear! Carpet-pissing pup!~
@952  = ~I wasn't even looking at you!~
@953  = ~PIG!~
@954  = ~Have you ever thought that if you killed all the men in the world, it might cause some difficulties?~
@955  = ~What makes you think I want to kill all men?~
@956  = ~...is that a joke?~
@957  = ~I've left plenty of men alive. I'd have done it in the duel, if I'd won.~
@958  = ~Taking a man's head is fun. Taking his pride? Putting him on his knees before you and watching his weakness sink in? That is *fulfilment.* ~
@959  = ~See, that's the irony. In a way, you need men more than anyone. Nothing else makes you happy.~
@960  = ~You arrogant...! That reminds me, it's been too long since I last fulfilled myself!~
@961  = ~Ow! Ow! You're only proving me right!~
@962  = ~You look the same age as me, Dave. How come nobody ever tells *you* you're not old enough to be out on your own?~
@963  = ~Probably because they're too busy telling me to stop worshipping Talos.~
@964  = ~Same thing in the end, though. "Stop doing what you want, I know best." I think it's great you broke away from it.~
@965  = ~But...?~
@966  = ~Hm? Oh, no. No buts. I'm serious. The world would be a lot more interesting if everyone was like you.~
@967  = ~Er, not that I'm trying to flirt with you or anything.~
@968  = ~Not that I'm *not*, either. I mean, not that I wouldn't if Eldoth weren't here.~
@969  = ~Hold on, that sounds like I'm waiting for him to turn his back. I meant if you'd never met him in the first place, not if he just went away for-~
@970  = ~Dave...~
@971  = ~I'M NOT TRYING TO STEAL YOU FROM ELDOTH. THAT'S THE POINT I'M FAILING TO MAKE.~
@972  = ~You know, Tiax, everyone rolls their eyes at you, but in my opinion, you're incredible.~
@973  = ~I can't think of a single priest who embodies their god the way you do. Complete megalomaniac. Thinks he rules over everything when he doesn't. I'm not making fun of you, it's just impossible to talk about you without sounding like I am.~
@974  = ~Tiax doesn't "think" he rules all! He knows! ~
@975  = ~See? You've got it down perfectly.  It's like watching art. ~
@976  = ~Alright, I know what you're thinking. "Stupid human, literally ten times younger than me, not even worth the time of day."~
@977  = ~Well well. A telepath among us.~
@978  = ~Uh, right. But I think as two priests of evil gods, we might have more in common than you-~
@979  = ~Shar is not an evil goddess.~
@980  = ~...yes she is.~
@981  = ~Caution, little altar boy. If you know what I'm thinking now, you know what happens to those who cast judgment on my faith.~
@982  = ~I'm not judging you! I mean, I am, but I'm not saying you shouldn't worship her. What kind of hypocrite would I be?~
@983  = ~But she is evil. One of the most evil.~
@984  = ~Be silent or be silenced, wael. You know nothing of her or me.~
@985  = ~Alright. Here's the proof, Viconia. Undead.~
@986  = ~When you call on Shar to deal with a horde of zombies, does she make them run away? Or does she make them obey you?~
@987  = ~What...?~
@988  = ~The second one, right? Evil.~
@989  = ~That's...you can't just...that is no measure of good or evil!~
@990  = ~Why not? I could ask "Does your goddess encourage murder?" and then we'd be arguing all day. Is murder always wrong, does life have any value, blah blah blah. The undead thing, it's just one or the other. No grey. Never fails.~
@991  = ~Just...just leave me be.~
@992  = ~Now that I've thought it over, Viconia, maybe we don't have that much in common after all.~
@993  = ~I follow Talos. You follow Shar. They're both...can I say ruthless? Is that alright? And that's about it.~
@994  = ~Such deliberation to conclude the obvious. That, in itself, is evidence.~
@995  = ~I watch the way you act, the way you talk to people, and it all seems so...typical. So preconditioned. Is there a single thought in your head that you came up with yourself? That wasn't just put there by your race or your religion?~
@996  = ~You walk a line between musing and sneering, male. Step lightly. Your Talos will only save you from so much.~
@997  = ~See? That's not something Viconia would say. That's something a drow woman would say.~
@998  = ~Even when you turned to Shar, that was just a reaction to Lolth abandoning you. Have you ever in your life done anything purely on your own initiative?~
@999  = ~Once.~
@1000 = ~Do you regret it?~
@1001 = ~I do not know yet.~
@1002 = ~You should try it more often. Maybe then you won't feel so trapped.~
@1003 = ~Do you want to talk, Xan?~
@1004 = ~About what?~
@1005 = ~I don't know. Anything. You seem like you need to talk to someone. All this doom and gloom business. It's not healthy.~
@1006 = ~Talk will not impede our demise.~
@1007 = ~It might help you stop thinking about it for a bit.~
@1008 = ~You'll excuse me if I don't invite your ridicule. The day has been tiring enough.~
@1009 = ~See? That's the doldrums talking. You're so jaded that you can't fathom anyone just wanting to help you. Has to be a cruel joke.~
@1010 = ~You are a Talassan. Even in my happiest moments, I could not have imagined a charitable Talassan.~
@1011 = ~So you were happy at some point.~
@1012 = ~Are you sure you don't want to talk?~
@1013 = ~I can't believe an elf is complaining to a human about the brevity of life. You've got centuries ahead of you...~
@1014 = ~In theory.~
@1015 = ~Alright, but even if you die tomorrow, so what? Then comes eternity. Swimming with the Seldarine in a lake of mead, forever.~
@1016 = ~One would get dreadful wrinkles.~
@1017 = ~That almost sounded like a joke.~
@1018 = ~Did it? It wasn't.~
@1019 = ~It's the fear of wasting yourself. That's what it is.~
@1020 = ~Is it.~
@1021 = ~The thought of the afterlife doesn't get you down. Pretend all you want, but you're a good person, and you know you've got a reward to look forward to. It's the thought of not being able to affect the world anymore.~
@1022 = ~You want to do something, or change something. I don't know what it is, but it's big. But one day, something got you thinking about mortality.~
@1023 = ~Did it.~
@1024 = ~Maybe a friend died. Or family. You started wondering when your time would come, and that goal of yours started seeming bigger and bigger until it was too big for anyone. And now you've decided it can't be done.~
@1025 = ~Have I.~
@1026 = ~You know how I know I'm right?~
@1027 = ~Do tell.~
@1028 = ~Because you love to tell people they're wrong, and yet the whole time I've been talking, you haven't done it once.~
@1029 = ~Perhaps I've accepted the futility of it.~
@1030 = ~"Perhaps."~
@1031 = ~Xzar, could you not...~
@1032 = ~Yeeeesssss?~
@1033 = ~Uh. Could you not do any of the things you do? Please?~
@1034 = ~Dave.~
@1035 = ~...what?~
@1036 = ~Come closer.~
@1037 = ~This is what I'm talking about. Please stop. Every single thing you do makes me uncomfortable. Just don't do anything. Just stand there quietly.~
@1038 = ~Gods, that's even worse. Forget it.~
@1039 = ~By what right do you seize control of the dead, Dave?~
@1040 = ~Um. Talos' right, I suppose.~
@1041 = ~No. No.~
@1042 = ~Velsharoon, yes. Jergal. Perhaps Shar, in a pinch. But Talos? What links storms and necromancy?~
@1043 = ~It's just something priests can do, Xzar. ~
@1044 = ~But it's not fair! Don't you see? I dedicate my every hour to the craft, while you need only dangle your little token and say please!~
@1045 = ~Where is the justice in that, Dave?! WHERE IS THE SENSE?!~
@1046 = ~Look, the world just doesn't make sense sometimes, and it isn't fair ever. I can't help you.~
@1047 = ~And I'm the mad one. I'm the mad one.~
@1048 = ~You keep them parchments in yer pack, son. I be keeping me temper out o' consideration for yer youth, but if ye set to preachin'...~
@1049 = ~Don't worry. I can barely convert drunk laypeople. Dwarven priests? Not even going to try.~
@1050 = ~Although...not to touch on a sore spot, but it doesn't sound like Clangeddin helped much when your mines were flooded.~
@1051 = ~And ye mean to say Talos would've protected us?~
@1052 = ~Oh, not at all. But he wouldn't have claimed to either.~
@1053 = ~How come you had nothing to say about us flooding your mine again?~
@1054 = ~Nothing to be said, lad. There's nay an Orothiar living or dead that'd work with bloodstained ore.~
@1055 = ~But that was where your clan lived. All that history, all that culture drowned. And I know for a fact that...uh...~
@1056 = ~Say again?~
@1057 = ~I mean, it mustn't be easy. To see your home destroyed.~
@1058 = ~I never said it were easy. Just that it had to be done.~
@1059 = ~I suppose it did.~
@1060 = ~Dave, it's past time we had words on yer faith. This road ye walk leads nowhere good.~
@1061 = ~Hold on, hold on. You can't do this.~
@1062 = ~You told me to keep the parchments in my pack. Remember? You weren't interested in hearing about my faith, which is fine. But if you're going to try and convert me now, it's only fair I get to do the same. So I'll listen to whatever you have to say, but you have to read a parchment first.~
@1063 = ~Lad, I'll take one if it please ye, but it'll come to naught. No words would turn me from Clangeddin, whether ye speak 'em or write 'em.~
@1064 = ~And yet you think having a quick chat will turn me from Talos.~
@1065 = ~Sorry, Yeslick. We'd just be wasting each other's time.~
@1066 = ~How many dragons do you think there are in the world, Flara?~
@1067 = ~I am not in the habit of counting.~
@1068 = ~Just compared to other species, though. There can't be that many or there'd be no room for the rest of us, right?~
@1069 = ~Some of us believe there IS no room for the rest of you. It's merely a matter of correcting it.~
@1070 = ~Oh.~
@1071 = ~You're...not one of them. Are you?~
@1072 = ~I waver. Sometimes I find it foolish, short-sighted. Who would press the coins and cut the gems? Who would be weak to define my strength?~
@1073 = ~Then again, sometimes I'm subjected to asinine questions like "How many dragons are there?"~
@1074 = ~...you could learn to press your own coins.~
@1075 = ~And sometimes I am also subjected to asinine *suggestions*.~
@1076 = ~Why do you not remedy this climate, boy? If I am caught in the rain one more time, I may burn you for warmth.~
@1077 = ~You want me to ask Talos to *prevent* storms? Why not just be direct? "Dave, I want you to kill yourself."~
@1078 = ~Isn't that the whole purpose of you priests? To act as conduits for the gods' favour?~
@1079 = ~Oh, of course. Pay tribute to the church and Talos stays his wrath. We make deals like that all the time. But the tribute part is important. I think you missed that step.~
@1080 = ~So you can't even supplicate your paltry human deity without a material offering.~
@1081 = ~Nnnot on behalf of non-Talassans, no.~
@1082 = ~Very well.~
@1083 = ~Dave, I want you to kill yourself.~
@1084 = ~Ha ha.~
@1085 = ~Uh...it's not funny when I can't tell you don't mean it.~
@1086 = ~It's a fortunate thing that trial of yours exists, boy. Taranis would have crushed you in any other arena.~
@1087 = ~Why do you think I didn't just challenge him to a normal duel? I've never seen a man that big. He'd have folded me in half.~
@1088 = ~You two have a lot in common, I think. Not least that you both call me "boy" all the time. I do have a name, you know.~
@1089 = ~I'm sure you do, boy. And now you will tell me, in detail, what you suppose I have in common with that lout. Unless you prefer play safely, in which case I'll allow you one chance to retract those words.~
@1090 = ~When's the last time you laughed?~
@1091 = ~And I mean a proper laugh. Not to mock or intimidate someone. Just a normal, everyday, having-a-good-time laugh.~
@1092 = ~...I don't see how that's of any importance.~
@1093 = ~I know you don't. And I'll bet you every coin I have that Taranis doesn't either.~
@1094 = ~So, Littlun! You worship...?~
@1095 = ~Solonor. And that ain't changing, so you just shush.~
@1096 = ~I was only asking.~
@1097 = ~Were you.~
@1098 = ~Yes! I'm not always trying to make converts. Sometimes it's nice to have a little string-free religion chat.~
@1099 = ~Fair enough, then.~
@1100 = ~...having said that, it must take an open mind for a halfling to follow an elven god.~
@1101 = ~Not really. The Seldarine were a part of my life, halfling gods weren't. Nothing needs an open mind when you're brought up with it.~
@1102 = ~In fact, I'm the most closed-minded, stubborn, bad-tempered sod you'll ever meet. Particularly concerning matters of faith.~
@1103 = ~Alright. I get the message, but there's no way that's actually true.~
@1104 = ~Why not?~
@1105 = ~You haven't shot me yet.~
@1106 = ~Did you know halflings don't have any evil gods?~
@1107 = ~Too much common sense, you think?~
@1108 = ~It just makes me wonder. Dwarves and gnomes too, barely any in their pantheons. But humans have loads.~
@1109 = ~And they're powerful. Prolific. You say "Urdlen" to anyone but a gnome, they probably won't know what you mean. Talos? Everyone knows him. Cyric, Shar. They're all big players.~
@1110 = ~Yeah, so what? If you want to brag about your wide selection of scumbags, you chose the wrong ear.~
@1111 = ~I'm not bragging. Just thinking.~
@1112 = ~Gods can't exist without worshippers. For humans have to so many evil ones...wouldn't that mean we're just bad?~
@1113 = ~You're not evil, Dave.~
@1114 = ~Aren't I? Uh, thanks. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.~
@1115 = ~I ain't being nice, I'm being honest. Still think you're a stupid tosser, but we've all been stupid tossers. Some grow out of it, some don't. I reckon you got time.~
@1116 = ~Here we are. One brook trout for the madame, fresh as fresh can be.~
@1117 = ~Did you take the scales off? She doesn't like the scales.~
@1118 = ~Yeah, I remembered. I swear, this cat eats better than we do. "As well I should," she says. Eh?~
@1119 = ~Oh yes, it's fine when *she* pets you, isn't it?~
@1120 = ~'Cause she knows who's got the goods.~
@1121 = ~She's still yours, though. Don't you forget that. And don't give me any Talassan rubbish about the strong surviving on their own, or whatever you people say. Just make an exception and look after her. You're all she's got now.~
@1122 = ~How do you catch them barehanded like that? Can you show me?~
@1123 = ~Can I have one of those Talos parchments?~
@1124 = ~Oh, of course! Absolutely! Wow, I never thought you'd be the type. That's wonderful. Hey, if you have any questions-~
@1125 = ~Any more? Need maybe four or five.~
@1126 = ~You think your friends might be interested?~
@1127 = ~I think last night's dinner is interested. Storm's a-brewing in here.~
@1128 = ~Oh. Ha ha. Right. I get it.~
@1129 = ~If I let you have some, will you at least read one before...?~
@1130 = ~Yeah, fine.~
@1131 = ~YES.~
@1132 = ~Not to pester you, but did you get a chance to read the...?~
@1133 = ~I did. Small wonder nobody's interested.~
@1134 = ~It's a tough sell, no mistake. But you have to be honest. If I tell people Talos is the god of sunshine and rainbows, they're not worshipping Talos. They're worshipping Lathander and calling him Talos.~
@1135 = ~Don't know how you have any members at all.~
@1136 = ~We don't really ask each other our reasons. I suppose some people might be bitter at the world. Some were forced into it, some heard a calling. And there are the odd loonies who only want to wreck things.~
@1137 = ~And you?~
@1138 = ~I dunno. Just thought I'd give it a go.~
@1139 = ~Maybe I need to take a more intimate approach. What do you think, Moidre?~
@1140 = ~You're a bit young for me.~
@1141 = ~Personal. I meant personal approach. I knew I shouldn't have said "intimate", I just had one of those moments where you can't think of the right word, not that I'm disparaging you as a woman or anything, ANYWAY I'd like to stop embarrassing myself now so let's move on.~
@1142 = ~I was thinking, maybe instead of telling people what Talos can do for them, I should share what he did for me. Really put myself out there and make a connection.~
@1143 = ~Doesn't seem like he did anything. Spells aside.~
@1144 = ~Maybe on the surface, but when you think about it...I used to be just Dave. Not Dave The Anything, just Dave. I'd walk down the street, people would see some boy with brown hair, then they'd go about their day and forget he existed.~
@1145 = ~Now I go into a village and I get chased out. They're scared of me. They tell their friends about me. Some people would actually like to kill me. And that's annoying, yes, but it means so much more than a polite nod.~
@1146 = ~Before I had this symbol on my chest, I was just drifting past the world. Now I'm IN it.~
@1147 = ~So you only wear it because it makes you important.~
@1148 = ~I'm not sure what's why I put it on, but it might be why I'm not taking it off. That and the looming threat of electrocution, obviously.~
@1149 = ~You said I'm too young for you. Is that the only reason, or...?~
@1150 = ~You cannot be that desperate.~
@1151 = ~If only.~
@1152 = ~You look nervous, boy. Pondering my tally of roasted paladins?~
@1153 = ~No, ma'am. I mean, Lady Flara. My lady. Whichever you prefer.~
@1154 = ~Speak with that much stammering compliance and you may call me whatever you wish. Now what has you so flustered, if not pyrophobia?~
@1155 = ~Just the heat, I'm sure.~
@1156 = ~Oh gods. You're lusting.~
@1157 = ~No, my lady! I would never...er, not that you aren't beautiful, but...~
@1158 = ~How many paladins did you say?~
@1159 = ~Seventy-two. Possibly seventy-three.~
@1160 = ~Tell me of chivalry, Ajantis.~
@1161 = ~Er. What of it, my lady?~
@1162 = ~Women. Chivalry and women. Tell me of that.~
@1163 = ~It is a knight's duty to always show respect to the fairer sex. There is little more to tell.~
@1164 = ~The rationale? Are female humans stronger? Smarter? I can't say I've noticed a difference, but I pay little mind.~
@1165 = ~It is not a matter of superiority, my lady.~
@1166 = ~Inferiority, then? Do they require coddling?~
@1167 = ~Well-~
@1168 = ~There are female knights too, are there not? Where are they in this tapestry?~
@1169 = ~It's...it's tradition. We've held these customs for many years. Surely you're at least somewhat familiar?~
@1170 = ~No. There are many reasons I deserve respect, but I do not count femininity among them. Outside of mating season, a dragon is a dragon is a...~
@1171 = ~Ah. Of course. Mating. Show a female preferential treatment in the hopes that she'll return it.~
@1172 = ~It's nothing so base as that, my lady.~
@1173 = ~I'm sure you believe as much, but for all your spluttering, your best explanation was "tradition." Mine is better.~
@1174 = ~I'm a fraction of my proper size and you still manage to get underfoot. How do you bear being so small, girl?~
@1175 = ~What's so bad about being small, crabbycakes? Ever heard that size isn't everything?~
@1176 = ~Often, but I doubt those who usually say it mean the same as you.~
@1177 = ~It's also wrong.~
@1178 = ~...wait. Wrong the way I say it or wrong the way other people-~
@1179 = ~Both.~
@1180 = ~Keep. Your hand. Out of my pocket.~
@1181 = ~But you always keep your things hidden! How can I not sneak a peek?~
@1182 = ~Let me satisfy your curiosity. Everything I carry is a cursed artefact. Anyone who touches them is immediately incinerated by an angry red dragon.~
@1183 = ~Wow! How come you never use that in a fight?~
@1184 = ~Flara! Out of that flimsy robe with you. Let us find a smith and fit you for armour.~
@1185 = ~And what of my magic, then?~
@1186 = ~Magic be damned. You've the mettle to take a blow and the muscle to give it back, and that merits a warrior's garb. Think how you'd look in the heart of battle, raining fire and sword upon our foes! Think how they'd quake!~
@1187 = ~They would, at that. But I find they quake well enough as-is.~
@1188 = ~Bah. A fine enough suit will turn your head. Mark my words, I'll have you plated before we part.~
@1189 = ~If you like. No-one who means to buy me expensive armour shall ever find me standing in their way.~
@1190 = ~This god of yours. Has he nothing to say on matters besides war?~
@1191 = ~What more should the god of war speak of?~
@1192 = ~Anything! Are your human deities so narrow in scope? Have they no greater philosophy beyond their pet causes?~
@1193 = ~Yes, a person should fight for what they value, but what else is there? When life is *not* presenting me with enemies to crush, what would Tempus have me do then?~
@1194 = ~Do you seek knowledge or counsel, Flara?~
@1195 = ~Just answer the question.~
@1196 = ~We must accept our trials, whatever they may be. Do not begrudge strife. Instead, be grateful that you may overcome, and grow.~
@1197 = ~And what if one can't overcome?~
@1198 = ~You only get to say "I couldn't" when you're dead. And then it does not matter.~
@1199 = ~What of your own god, Flara? Is there naught they can do for you?~
@1200 = ~I do not favour any deity. Why should they favour me?~
@1201 = ~You are faithless, then?~
@1202 = ~No, but there are few "priests" among dragons, as you understand it. We respect the gods' divinity, find wisdom in their teachings, but worship is not in our nature. It is a thing for weak minds. Needy minds.~
@1203 = ~You answer advice with insult? I should strike you.~
@1204 = ~It is as it is. If there is a mountain, the tall gaze over the peak, and the small ask what they see. They have no other choice.~
@1205 = ~You are not so tall now.~
@1206 = ~...yes.~
@1207 = ~Faith is not an admission of weakness, Flara. Merely the acceptance of strength.~
@1208 = ~Humanity hasn't robbed you of your lustre, dear ruby.~
@1209 = ~Yes it has. But it must suffice for now.~
@1210 = ~To suffice for eyes as discerning as yours is to excel. You, milady, need no fire to melt a man.~
@1211 = ~Elf, if cows wore skirts, I believe you would flash your teeth and lay roses at their feet and never once consider that they might prefer bulls.~
@1212 = ~If I may, perhaps one who doesn't seek the company of us lowly beings should take a form less pleasing?~
@1213 = ~No. I will not ugly myself to be rid of your lechery, nor will I be expected to.~
@1214 = ~'Tis a bitter wine this groghouse pours. Sit with me, my honey, and sweeten it.~
@1215 = ~I am not interested in you. Go away.~
@1216 = ~Ah, but words can so easily deceive. The heart never lies, and I cannot lay my own to rest until I know yours! The agony of uncertainty is too great!~
@1217 = ~Are you so drunk on yourself that you can't even interpret outright rejection?~
@1218 = ~Consider your answer carefully, because my only recourse from here is violence.~
@1219 = ~Strike me down if it please you. I have long accepted that beautiful women would be the end of me.~
@1220 = ~But I would no sooner hit the ground than rise a revenant if I died without showing the depths of my passion. For you, I would rob the Moonstone Palace itself, and swim to you with its riches on my back.~
@1221 = ~Would you? Good. Do so.~
@1222 = ~Do you value that creature or not, Coran?~
@1223 = ~Which creature might that be?~
@1224 = ~Your infant. You have us chase down some cuckolded hexweaver to save its life, then bid it goodbye with nary a second glance.~
@1225 = ~Not that I expect consistency from you, but this is flighty even by your standards.~
@1226 = ~Now Flara. Just because I won't let a girl die in her mother's arms doesn't mean I want her shackled to me.~
@1227 = ~And who knows? Perhaps every now and then, dear Brielbara shall find a purse of ill-guarded gold at her door, and spare a thought for the dashing rogue who lets her child want for nothing.~
@1228 = ~So you do value it.~
@1229 = ~...I suppose. In some way. What of it?~
@1230 = ~That which has value should be kept.~
@1231 = ~Flara, if thy claims are indeed true, thou hast been given a valuable opportunity to learn perspective.~
@1232 = ~I have already learned a great deal.~
@1233 = ~Oh?~
@1234 = ~Yes. For example, when you lose the capacity to bite a full-grown human in half, you are more likely to be lectured on perspective by overinflated hedge witches.~
@1235 = ~"Overinflated hedge witches." A fine summation of Rashemen's arcane talent.~
@1236 = ~Scoff if thou must, but I too know what it is to be venerated. None in Rashemen are held in higher esteem than the Wychlaran. The common folk hinged on my words and coveted my approval. When I gave an order, disobedience earned a death sentence.~
@1237 = ~Yet here, in the Sword Coast, I am naught but a humble traveller. I demand no greater recognition, and therefore invite no trouble.~
@1238 = ~And were subsequently abducted by gnolls. If *that* is your endorsement, I believe I shall stay as I am.~
@1239 = ~Hast thou braced for the possibility that thy condition is irreversible?~
@1240 = ~It isn't.~
@1241 = ~How art thou so sure? Its nature hath eluded thee thus far.~
@1242 = ~Nevertheless.~
@1243 = ~Thy denial is borne of fear. 'Tis understandable, but-~
@1244 = ~My denial is borne of certainty!  There is nothing, NOTHING in this world I cannot conquer! If I am made a creeping, defenceless slug, I will overcome! If I am made dust on the breeze, I will overcome!~
@1245 = ~In future, save your "insight" for that frothing halfwit of yours. No-one else here stands to learn from it.~
@1246 = ~Flara, I will not indulge your fantasies; at least, not those absent my bedroll.~
@1247 = ~You are a human woman with sorcerous blood. In Thay, this would make you a test subject with aspirations of concubinage.~
@1248 = ~And these test subjects of yours, do they often breathe fire?~
@1249 = ~Give me the proper scroll and I'll spin a web. That does not make me a spider.~
@1250 = ~Give a wizard any scroll and he'll wield power. That does not make him strong.~
@1251 = ~It is said that dragons savour the taste of jewels, Flara. That being the case, I've a fine pair here you might snack on.~
@1252 = ~Take note; I cook my food.~
@1253 = ~Change your colours, wench. There is one Red Wizard in this group and I will not have you lumped in again.~
@1254 = ~Ugh. Put this to rest, you petulant brat. Idiots see two robes of the same hue and leap to conclusions. It means nothing.~
@1255 = ~Ah, but today it was merely some simple commoner. Who knows who might make the same mistake tomorrow?~
@1256 = ~After all, the Red Wizards frown upon relations among colleagues. Whatever shall my peers think when I consummate my conquest of you?~
@1257 = ~That is your concern, and therefore your clothes that need to change. If you'll hold still a moment, I have an immediate means to turn them black.~
@1258 = ~Oh yes. The implied threat of incineration, yet again. Is there nothing else in your repertoire?~
@1259 = ~Overt threats of incineration. And actual incineration.~
@1260 = ~(One day I'll prepare Protection from Fire before I come to you. Then we'll see. Then we'll see.)~
@1261 = ~Might I take the tension out of those shoulders, madam?~
@1262 = ~What breed of madness makes you think you deserve to touch me?~
@1263 = ~"No thank you" is more customary in these parts.~
@1264 = ~Thank you for what? Your presumption?~
@1265 = ~Ah, the nuances of common expressions are lost on you. Forgive me.~
@1266 = ~Do you speak draconic? Perhaps then I can more eloquently convey my sentiments. In lieu of that, I shall simply ask that you crawl into a privy and die among your peers.~
@1267 = ~I already have this one pawing at me. I do not need another.~
@1268 = ~Why, Flara! You would give yourself to me alone?~
@1269 = ~If it came down to it, I would kill you first. Though I'm sure you'll twist that into some bizarre sign of favour.~
@1270 = ~This Skie business is a disgrace, Eldoth. I'm amazed that one so spineless can walk upright.~
@1271 = ~What is this now? Am I to believe the girl means something to you?~
@1272 = ~Less than the grass she walks on. And had you seized her father's assets by force, that would be a different matter, but I would sooner let gold gather dust than siphon it like a leech.~
@1273 = ~That is your prerogative, madam, and I would never dream of disputing it. You may keep your pride, and I shall keep my wealth.~
@1274 = ~Or I could destroy you and have both. Do you understand now?~
@1275 = ~Precious little grasp of subtlety among your kind, hmm?~
@1276 = ~We grasp it well enough to know it isn't always the answer.~
@1277 = ~Watch that breath of yours, red one. You will suffer for any tree that catches it.~
@1278 = ~If it should please me to let the whole forest catch it, neither you nor all your kin would stop me. Be thankful I appreciate scenery.~
@1279 = ~You are no better than a city dweller! Forests are not "scenery"! They are life!~
@1280 = ~Ah, well. I have rather less appreciation for life, discounting my own. By all means, I will accept your correction, but are you certain you won't regret it?~
@1281 = ~Honestly. "Life." Do you realise how absurd it is that I can hold a plant hostage to you? How can anyone survive by such a creed?~
@1282 = ~We do. We have survived before you, and shall survive after. ~
@1283 = ~As for you, your plight is nature's vengeance. I suggest you make restitution.~
@1284 = ~Suppose these Shadow Druids did not exist. What do you believe would happen?~
@1285 = ~Without us? Nature would die. I am certain of it.~
@1286 = ~...yes. Very ominous, but what does that actually mean? By "nature", you refer to flowers and squirrels and such?~
@1287 = ~I refer to everything in this world that is worth preserving. ~
@1288 = ~In which you include squirrels. Why are they worth preserving? What should happen if all squirrels were to die? An overabundance of acorns?~
@1289 = ~If squirrels disappeared, so too would those who prey on them, and the trees that need them for renewal. Which would in turn affect other species. Who can say where it would end?~
@1290 = ~However old you claim you are, nature is older, and she knows better than you how things should be. To defy her will has dire consequences for all of us.~
@1291 = ~So it does lead back to yourselves, in the end. Thank Asgorath. I can at least make sense of selfishness, however roundabout.~
@1292 = ~It's not selfishness! The Shadow Druids work towards a greater-~
@1293 = ~Oh, do be quiet. I am not trying to slander you. Selfishness is the most natural thing in the world.~
@1294 = ~This Silke seemed talented enough in magic, by human standards. ~
@1295 = ~Oh, frighteningly so. When she turned on <CHARNAME>, I was certain I'd be writing <PRO_HISHER> dirge.~
@1296 = ~Quite devious as well. For a human. Quite sharp.~
@1297 = ~Yes, I had no idea she was capable of such a thing. All that time...~
@1298 = ~Explain why we have you and not her.~
@1299 = ~Er...~
@1300 = ~Quickly.~
@1301 = ~Because she was evil.~
@1302 = ~A meaningless label.~
@1303 = ~Because she's dead?~
@1304 = ~Easily fixed.~
@1305 = ~Because...she deceived us. She tried to play us for fools. Surely you wouldn't stand for that?~
@1306 = ~Fair point, but I'd thought to hear less of her faults and more of your merits.~
@1307 = ~I was taught at the college in Berdusk.~
@1308 = ~<CHARNAME>, I believe we have some options to weigh.~
@1309 = ~Bard. I suppose you have many a tale of dragonslaying in your repertoire?~
@1310 = ~I do, milady.~
@1311 = ~No you don't.~
@1312 = ~...ah.~
@1313 = ~But perhaps; and pay attention, for the difference is subtle; you have one or two stories of dragons, slaying?~
@1314 = ~No, milady.~
@1315 = ~You will shortly.~
@1316 = ~Right. I'll, er...just get my quill?~
@1317 = ~Doesn't it hurt to breathe fire?~
@1318 = ~No more than it hurts you to breathe air.~
@1319 = ~So does that mean I'm an air dragon?~
@1320 = ~Don't be ridiculous.~
@1321 = ~Hey, sure it does. I've been spewing air all my life and it's never done me no harm. Has to mean something, don't it?~
@1322 = ~The draconic spectrum doesn't include-~
@1323 = ~Beware my dragon's breath! Fwoosh!~
@1324 = ~There are no air-breathing dragons!~
@1325 = ~I mean...obviously we all breathe air, but...~
@1326 = ~Be quiet, girl.~
@1327 = ~Nacho...nacho...Perry!~
@1328 = ~*Facio voco ferre.*~
@1329 = ~Ohhh.~
@1330 = ~Honestly, girl.~
@1331 = ~Well that's what it sounds like!~
@1332 = ~I guess your version makes more sense, though. Always wondered who Perry was.~
@1333 = ~It isn't "my version." It's the correct version. And when, pray tell, did you decide I was your tutor?~
@1334 = ~Uh, never. I'm just practicing by myself, but every time I make a mistake, you roll your eyes and correct me.~
@1335 = ~Well. Yes. Naturally. If you insist on muttering incantations, we might as well have you get them right.~
@1336 = ~You musta had a home, right Flara? When you were a dragon, I mean. Not that I want rid of you, but I'll wager you'd find more answers there than here.~
@1337 = ~What keen insight.~
@1338 = ~Let us presume this brilliant plan has, in fact, crossed my mind before. Why might I not enact it?~
@1339 = ~Oh. You don't remember where you came from?~
@1340 = ~Huh. Me neither.~
@1341 = ~No? Were you not raised along with <CHARNAME> in that library of yours?~
@1342 = ~Raised, yeah. Not born. Dunno where my parents are. Dunno why I was brought there.~
@1343 = ~If anyone would've known, it's Gorion. And now he's gone.~
@1344 = ~I see.~
@1345 = ~Heh, could be I really am a dragon. Who knows?~
@1346 = ~One of those infernal brasses, if anything. Utterly incapable of silence.~
@1347 = ~Rude! Had me thinking we were bonding just now, too.~
@1348 = ~It wasn't an insult, girl. A dragon is a dragon, brass or not.~
@1349 = ~You, druid. Your ilk know the art of shapeshifting, do they not? Surely one of your fellows has some idea what happened to me.~
@1350 = ~*sigh* Ours is a different breed of magic, Flara. You would be better asking a mage, if anyone.~
@1351 = ~Don't you dare brush me off! Do you mean to say your magic is flawless? That none of you have EVER had difficulty shifting form?~
@1352 = ~Hmm. Now that you mention it, I do recall a tale I was told as an acolyte. About a young druid who became a mouse, and could not become a man again.~
@1353 = ~Yes? And what did he do?~
@1354 = ~He learned to respect other mice.~
@1355 = ~Blisters. I have blisters on my feet. Every day I find something new to hate about being human.~
@1356 = ~Grin and bear it for now, and I'll make a poultice when next we rest.~
@1357 = ~Ugh. Next you'll be offering to lick my wounds clean.~
@1358 = ~If you don't want it...~
@1359 = ~I shouldn't *need* it. I shouldn't be injured by something as simple as walking.  I shouldn't...be this frail.~
@1360 = ~Patience. Your feet will harden to the chafing, in time.~
@1361 = ~I am not a child, druid. Do not placate me with wives' tales.~
@1362 = ~I do no such thing. Our skin remembers where it has suffered, and grows thicker and stronger in response. That is the truth.~
@1363 = ~Hmph. You should know, I suppose.~
@1364 = ~We are, all of us, frail and vulnerable. But we adapt more quickly than you think.~
@1365 = ~Dragons have hoards, right? Where's yours?~
@1366 = ~We do have hoards. We also don't disclose their location to any fool who asks.~
@1367 = ~But you got one, yeah? Where is it?~
@1368 = ~The implication was "I'm not telling you."~
@1369 = ~Right, right. But where exactly is it?~
@1370 = ~Well. This is refreshingly blunt.~
@1371 = ~Does that mean you'll tell me where it is?~
@1372 = ~Y'ever pile it all up and roll around in it?~
@1373 = ~...sometimes.~
@1374 = ~It's good, isn't it?~
@1375 = ~Y'ever throw it in the air and let it rain on your head?~
@1376 = ~Yes.~
@1377 = ~Hah! I like to keep the helmet on. Makes more noise.~
@1378 = ~Y'ever shovel it down your breeches and walk around like...~
@1379 = ~Just me, then.~
@1380 = ~Khalid. Carry this.~
@1381 = ~As you w-wish.~
@1382 = ~Take my waterskin, too. It needs refilling.~
@1383 = ~Y-yes, of course...~
@1384 = ~And see that the fire is better stoked this eve. No more huddling over embers. Make it roar, understand?~
@1385 = ~Enough, Flara. He is not your servant.~
@1386 = ~You are all my servants. He seems to be the only one who realises.~
@1387 = ~Jaheira, I don't mind. R-really, it's-~
@1388 = ~You see? He agrees. Stop being so self-absorbed and let him do as he pleases.~
@1389 = ~*sigh* I see we shall have to practice the word "no" again.~
@1390 = ~Khalid. You and Jaheira have mated, have you not?~
@1391 = ~F-Flara! That's rather personal, don't you think?~
@1392 = ~Is it?~
@1393 = ~...yes. It is.~
@1394 = ~I only wonder at the purpose of this union. If you've bred, your business is over, yet you remain joined at the hip. If not, why the delay?~
@1395 = ~I...I don't even know how to begin explaining this to you.~
@1396 = ~Then it's probably not worth hearing. Don't bother.~
@1397 = ~What do you intend for this Tazok when you find him?~
@1398 = ~Death.~
@1399 = ~And nothing more? Will you not make him suffer first? Beg your forgiveness?~
@1400 = ~One step down that path and I would walk it for the rest of my life.~
@1401 = ~Hardly a problem, if the path is the correct one.~
@1402 = ~It isn't. It leads away from her.~
@1403 = ~Have you considered that you may be in the wrong, Kivan? That this vengeance of yours may prove unwarranted?~
@1404 = ~Never?~
@1405 = ~Never.~
@1406 = ~Good. All slights should be repaid.~
@1407 = ~My wife's murder was not a "slight."~
@1408 = ~Yes, well. Some species value mates more than others. The point stands.~
@1409 = ~What troubles you, Flara? Let Minsc put his boot in it!~
@1410 = ~If I must be human, I at least take comfort in being a tall one. And now here you are to dwarf me.~
@1411 = ~Ahh. Yes, there are many in Rashemen who envy Minsc his size. Although not so many are women.~
@1412 = ~Do not be sad of your smallness, Flara. Boo is only as big as his cousins' toes, but every bit as fierce!~
@1413 = ~You just compared me to a rodent. If I were "every bit as fierce", you would not be about to get away with it.~
@1414 = ~What is this Ice Dragon Lodge, exactly? I suppose you dive into barrels of mead and drink delusions of wyrmslaying into your heads?~
@1415 = ~No no no! An Ice Dragon berserker fights *like* a dragon, not against them. Although the diving, yes. This does sometimes happen.~
@1416 = ~Explain yourself.~
@1417 = ~Every lodge has a beast, you see? The tiger, the owlbear, the stag. And every berserker trains to fight as their beast does. The tigers rend, the owlbears wrestle, and the stags charge.~
@1418 = ~And the ice dragons? Surely you don't breathe frost.~
@1419 = ~They harden themselves with the cold. When I return from my dajemma, they will make me survive a tenday in the northern winter, without furs or fire.~
@1420 = ~So you seek to emulate us. Admirable, if not attainable. Though better any dragon but those self-righteous silvers.~
@1421 = ~As a boy, Minsc's friends told him of a Red Dragon Lodge. To enter, he had to sit upon a hot coal and make not a sound until it cooled.~
@1422 = ~There is not a Red Dragon Lodge.~
@1423 = ~I seem to recall finding halflings especially flavourful. Perhaps it's your hearty diets.~
@1424 = ~Do ye find sharpened steel flavourful? That'll be yer first course.~
@1425 = ~So defensive. I was simply musing on a memory, little one. For now, I'd rather you be meatshield than meat.~
@1426 = ~Muse in silence, then. I've heard enough of cannibalism to last an elf's life.~
@1427 = ~Now Monty, don't exaggerate. I only mentioned it once.~
@1428 = ~An' that's enough.~
@1429 = ~If ever I catch teeth in me, mark me well. On dagger point or privy top, there'll be a reckoning.~
@1430 = ~Hoi, witch! Mayhap I just awoke from fever dreams, but I swear I seen ye breathe fire more'n once.~
@1431 = ~I am a dragon, halfling. A red dragon.~
@1432 = ~Yet camptime comes, and ye sit on yer mysteriously scaleless hind watchin' us piddle about with flint and tinder.~
@1433 = ~My flames are for igniting flesh, not twigs. Perhaps we can reach a compromise if you'll offer yourself as fuel.~
@1434 = ~Feckin' mages. Fair wonder ye find air worthy of yer lungs. As if one persnickety spellslinger weren't enough.~
@1435 = ~Monty. Monty, this is pigeon.~
@1436 = ~I wanted pheasant, Monty.~
@1437 = ~You could offer *him* as fuel.~
@1438 = ~Aye, now yer thinkin'.~
@1439 = ~If you're really a dragon then answer this. What is the average wingspan of a freshly hatched red wyrmling?~
@1440 = ~In your tiny world, that exists only in your tiny mind, do dragons go around measuring one another?~
@1441 = ~You don't know, do you?~
@1442 = ~No. No, I do not. Congratulations, gnome. You "win."~
@1443 = ~A beauteous creature who covets riches. Have I found a sister or a rival, I wonder?~
@1444 = ~You think coaxing pocket money from the desperate puts you on equal terms with me?~
@1445 = ~Goodness. That answers that. Only a sister could be so catty.~
@1446 = ~That treasure trove I led you to. That was a desperate man's pocket money to you?~
@1447 = ~It may as well have been after sharing it out. If we were anything alike, you wouldn't have been grovelling for help. Every last coin would be yours.~
@1448 = ~If we were anything alike, I wouldn't have known about the place at all. Better a little something than a lot of nothing, hmm?~
@1449 = ~An experiment, then. You flutter your eyelashes while I flap my wings, and we will see who travels further.~
@1450 = ~You've only arms to flap, dear. Sorry to remind you.~
@1451 = ~Why so down, Flara? Was it my little crack about arm-flapping? Surely time has dulled the sting.~
@1452 = ~It takes more than ill-chosen words to wound me.~
@1453 = ~Yes yes, I'm sure it does. Come now, enough bickering. Let's have some hopeful sap buy us a drink or two.~
@1454 = ~I will show you my hoard one day. Perhaps I will bury you in it, and let you contemplate the insignificance of your escapades.~
@1455 = ~If anything, I'll be contemplating what a shameful waste it is.~
@1456 = ~You have no imagination, darling. To you, gold is just gold. To me, it's fine food, exotic wines, silk spun by creatures most men have never heard of...~
@1457 = ~Then you are a fool. That which has value should be kept.~
@1458 = ~Agreed. But nothing has more value than a decadent life, and I mean to keep mine as long as I can.~
@1459 = ~Are you sure you wouldn't like that drink? I'll do the talking.~
@1460 = ~Turn that sword away before I weld it to you.~
@1461 = ~I want to see how you fight.~
@1462 = ~You know perfectly well how I fight. Fire, havoc, destruction, conquest.~
@1463 = ~I want to see how you *really* fight. How you kill from an inch away.~
@1464 = ~Could you do it? With your magic spent and your fire burned out? When all that kept me from your throat was a shaft of steel, would you put it in me?~
@1465 = ~I'd rip you in half, girl. No steel involved.~
@1466 = ~I thought you might say that.~
@1467 = ~Gooods. I need to kill something. Now.~
@1468 = ~Flara. You're a woman with sense. What say we ditch the deadweight and carve out our own fortune? We'll have the coast licking our boots in a tenday. ~
@1469 = ~I thought you'd handed your reins to <CHARNAME>. Or have you forgotten your pledge already?~
@1470 = ~Bah, the pledge can hang. I said I'd lend my sword. Never said for how long.~
@1471 = ~If you truly felt that way, you'd have left already. Bluster all you like, but you know full well that your own words bind you.~
@1472 = ~Careful. You're as much a lackey in this gang as I am. Start looking down your nose and I'll smash it. ~
@1473 = ~I am here because it suits my purposes. You are here even though it chafes you. You will remain here after this conversation is over, because you understand nothing of freedom. Freedom from weakness, from law, from the grip of the earth itself. When you learn that, perhaps then we may speak of "our" fortune.~
@1474 = ~But you never will.~
@1475 = ~Away from me. Pallid, gutless larva.~
@1476 = ~I just wanted to-~
@1477 = ~Away. Do not speak to me, do not approach me. Bow your head low and pray I forget you are here.~
@1478 = ~Why? What have I done?~
@1479 = ~You know full well what you've done. Throwing away power and wealth for some silly fling. I could not be more disgusted with you if you oozed pus.~
@1480 = ~It's not some silly fling! Eldoth loves m-~
@1481 = ~I'm not telling you he does or doesn't! I'm telling you you're a fool regardless! He could love you with every inch of his being and it still wouldn't equal a fraction of what you've squandered!~
@1482 = ~As of now, you exist on my sufferance alone. If you remind me of your presence again, I will drag your smouldering corpse back to your father and have him thank me for bettering his heir.~
@1483 = ~Flara, Tiax worries for your sanity.~
@1484 = ~Such a beautiful and intelligent woman would make a fine queen...no, not a queen. A mistress. Tiax will rule alone.~
@1485 = ~But before that, you must shed this delusion. Tiax cannot allow craziness between his bedsheets.~
@1486 = ~I refuse to acknowledge this. I refuse.~
@1487 = ~It amuses me no end that your people speak of ruling the surface, drow.~
@1488 = ~The time may come sooner than you think. Then you would learn the place of laughter in our world.~
@1489 = ~Oh? Finally ready to act, are you? I expect you've spent all those generations "biding your time."~
@1490 = ~Perhaps you'll best the elves, eventually. Perhaps humans and dwarves too. But no matter how many you conquer, how can we but smile as ants defeat termites and declare themselves gods?~
@1491 = ~You are a prideful creature. I must admit, despite everything, so am I. But know that what I am about to say is no boast. It is a warning, one you would do well to heed.~
@1492 = ~Your overconfidence will cost you more than you know. All that the drow have, they paid for in blood. They carved out an empire among the terrors of the dark, and now they thrive where others would crumble.~
@1493 = ~It is a softer world here. A lazier world. And when...WHEN they come to your soft, lazy world, if they find you complacent, they will bring you all to heel. Even dragons.~
@1494 = ~They would be the first to try, certainly. And when others saw the consequences, they would no doubt be the last.~
@1495 = ~Tell me of this Shar of yours. What does she offer, that you supplicate yourself?~
@1496 = ~Ugh. Flara, I'd at least thought you above foolish questions. You've felt the benefits of her power more than once.~
@1497 = ~Yes yes, magic. What aside from that? Any fool can jot down some scrolls.~
@1498 = ~No. I am jalil. Female. To draw power from parchment scribbles is the lot of males.~
@1499 = ~Better to be burdened with books than chains.~
@1500 = ~Do not call me slave, wael. Some things I will abide, but do not EVER call me slave.~
@1501 = ~Oh, come now. You are all thralls of your spider goddess. You may deceive yourselves into taking pride in it, but let's not pretend it isn't true.~
@1502 = ~Lolth no longer holds me. She will never again hold me.~
@1503 = ~No. Someone else will.~
@1504 = ~You walk in light, but you're still lost in the dark. If it was magic you wanted, you could have taken it for yourself, but any notion of courage or independence in your heart, your collar chokes on the way to your head.~
@1505 = ~Shall we come back to your question? Speak another word and I will teach you more of Shar than you ever wanted to know.~
@1506 = ~Enough of your pitymongering, elf. If you're so certain of death, kindly dig yourself a grave and leave us to our business.~
@1507 = ~Forgive me if I don't. Your business is hopeless enough as it is. ~
@1508 = ~So you've reminded us. Many, many times. I dare say every time you open your mouth. If you aren't seeking validation, brood more quietly.~
@1509 = ~How often are we reminded of your draconic heritage, Flara?~
@1510 = ~It is not just a heritage! I *am* a dragon!~
@1511 = ~Thank you for demonstrating my point.~
@1512 = ~This is why I stay. This group needs at least *one* representative of the real world.~
@1513 = ~I notice we both survived our assault on the Cloakwood mines.~
@1514 = ~A wonder we don't have you scout for us, with such powers of observation.~
@1515 = ~I seem to recall you saying we wouldn't. You were proven wrong.~
@1516 = ~You said much the same of our journey to the bandit camp, and again, you were wrong. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, you claimed we'd all be dead before we even learned of its location.~
@1517 = ~Perhaps you notice a pattern emerging?~
@1518 = ~A pattern of postponing the inevitable.~
@1519 = ~Nothing but triumph is inevitable while I stand among you. I will refute your doomsaying as much as need be until you understand that.~
@1520 = ~One could almost accuse you of trying to reassure me.~
@1521 = ~True. That's enough of that.~
@1522 = ~Flara, Flara, Flara! Less zeal, if you please! Such a trial to work with burnt materials.~
@1523 = ~Your necrophilia is not my concern. Find corpses on your own time.~
@1524 = ~Necrophilia? No no, my delicious comrade. *Necromancy*. Often confused. Mind you, mummy always said one can't spell necromancer without romance...~
@1525 = ~Quiet. Enough. I am not your little halfling friend, and I am not going to indulge your "madness."~
@1526 = ~There is nothing wrong with you that can't be fixed with a sound beating. Unless you'd like me to demonstrate, stop it.~
@1527 = ~Stop being mad?~
@1528 = ~Yes. Stop it at once.~
@1529 = ~Flara. I tried it.~
@1530 = ~I tried it. I tried being sane. I tried it.~
@1531 = ~Did you. Not for very long, it seems.~
@1532 = ~Not long at all. As soon as I began, I remembered why I chose madness instead.~
@1533 = ~I do not think I will try it again. Ever, ever again.~
@1534 = ~Hee hee. And you are a dragon. A great, big dragon with crimson scales and frightful pointy teeth! I believe! I believe!~
@1535 = ~All yer talk of dragons brings to mind a-~
@1536 = ~It is not just "talk".~
@1537 = ~Aye, as ye say. But it put me in mind of an old dwarven tale. Story goes that a great red dragon ran a whole clan from their mountain an' laid itself to sleep in the treasure room. Perhaps ye've heard o' such a thing?~
@1538 = ~It's not uncommon. Dwarven caverns are hoards and lairs in one. A tempting target.~
@1539 = ~What then? I suppose some brave survivors banded together and slew the greatly superior creature through some ridiculous contrivance.~
@1540 = ~Arrow in the belly, to me recollection.~
@1541 = ~...an arrow.~
@1542 = ~Aye.~
@1543 = ~One arrow. From a bow. A pinprick. That was sufficient to kill an ancient wyrm.~
@1544 = ~So it goes.~
@1545 = ~Your people either have quite the imagination or none at all.~
@1546 = ~There were more to that tale I meant to say, Flara. Plain slipped me mind, it did.~
@1547 = ~What is it? Are you going to tell me it was a particularly large arrow?~
@1548 = ~The lesson. 'Tis told for two reasons. One, it be a bloody good story. Two, it be a warning against greed.~
@1549 = ~'Twas greed brought ruin on the clan. They mined more'n they could ever need, enough fer the dragon to bury itself in, just fer the sake o' glitter. An' the dragon too, died fer greed, guarding gold it had no use fer.~
@1550 = ~What does it say of you that you take lessons from things that didn't happen?~
@1551 = ~Flara...~
@1552 = ~Fine. Disregarding that, what would you lay down your life for? Honour? Your "dwarven pride"? Explain the use of those.~
@1553 = ~Now wait jus' a minute. Me honour be worth more to me than-~
@1554 = ~I asked what use it is, not what it's worth. What do you use honour for? What actual need do you have of honour? None. But you fight for it it all the same.~
@1555 = ~Value is not utility, dwarf. And that which has value should be kept.~
@1556 = ~Stand clear, little one. I seldom watch where I step.~
@1557 = ~Littlun.~
@1558 = ~@94 /* Littlun */, not "little one." ~
@1559 = ~The difference being?~
@1560 = ~Well, one of 'em's patronising big folk rubbish that I don't much care for. The other is my name.~
@1561 = ~They mean the same thing!~
@1562 = ~At first, yeah. When you ask someone to use one and they keep using the other, then it means something else.~
@1563 = ~That crossbow of yours. It is one of a kind, yes?~
@1564 = ~Unless someone's resurrected my dad lately, yeah.~
@1565 = ~Unless my dad's come out of retirement lately, yeah.~
@1566 = ~I imagine it's quite valuable.~
@1567 = ~More than all the coin in Faerun, so you can stop imagining.~
@1568 = ~Coin? You think I want to sell it? Haggle with some stubborn peddler for half its worth? Don't be ridiculous. That which has value should be kept.~
@1569 = ~Well I ain't letting *you* keep it.~
@1570 = ~No? Consider it. It will almost certainly outlive you. What then? Would you have it rot in the soil, forgotten?~
@1571 = ~Entrust it to me, and I should guard it as long as I breathe. It will be an antique one day. A relic. The name of Plunkett shall live, even as millions more fade. And perhaps one day, someone shall write a book of your father's craft, as he did for those before him.~
@1572 = ~...I'll think about it. But I ain't going nowhere for a while yet, so don't get no ideas.~
@1573 = ~It's a shame about that Sigurd bloke. Real shame.~
@1574 = ~If you grieve for his demise so, perhaps you'd care to join him. There'll be plenty of room beside him and his cohorts for another unmarked grave.~
@1575 = ~Would you leave off with the huff and puff for one sodding second? I meant it's a shame he weren't telling the truth. That you didn't really have a family out there, waiting for you to come home again.~
@1576 = ~Oh, spare me. You think I care one whit if I have the love and affection of my dear mama? If you intend to feed me such mush, be warned that if I vomit, it will be in your pack.~
@1577 = ~Everyone should grow up with a family. Everyone.~
@1578 = ~If they are born soft and helpless as you are, yes. Dragons are not, and if you did not know that then consider yourself informed. Now, enough of this-~
@1579 = ~It ain't just about survival, Flara. You're surviving now. You're alive, healthy, fed. Is that all you want? Are you happy, surviving?~
@1580 = ~This discussion is pointless! Even if what you say is true, and I maintain that it is NOT, the significance is lost on me. I have no frame of reference for the life you wish me to have.~
@1581 = ~Yeah you do. You have us.~
@1582 = ~This ain't a family, not by a long shot. But we fight and cuss and drive each other up the wall sometimes, and even as we do it, we all look out for each other, and that's something like how families are.~
@1583 = ~Is it really so bad? Having people around you that give a damn?~
@1584 = ~I...never said that it was, bad, halfling. I said that I don't *need*-~
@1585 = ~I know you don't need it. Nobody needs it. But they should have it all the same.~
@1586 = ~Dwarf, if you intend to commit suicide, do so outside of combat. I'm like to catch you in a blast the way you fling yourself about.~
@1587 = ~Didn't know you cared.~
@1588 = ~I don't. I merely don't wish to look incompetent.~
@1589 = ~Should've just let me believe. Might've done more to convince me.~
@1590 = ~I don't wish to look compassionate either.~
@1591 = ~You're awful bothered about how we look at you.~
@1592 = ~And now the ice is thinning. I'd rather not kill you accidentally. Doing it deliberately is another matter.~
@1593 = ~I tire of standing in your shadow, dwarf. Go and be someone else's limpet for a while.~
@1594 = ~Sure. Soon as I hear the orders.~
@1595 = ~You just did.~
@1596 = ~From the person I answer to, I mean.~
@1597 = ~You have some terrible misconceptions about the chain of command. Namely that you believe there IS ONE. There are subordinates, and there is me. It is that simple. Now go.~
@1598 = ~Punish me, then. Crush your disobedient servant. I know you wouldn't think twice. Just as well, 'cause I'm not budging until the wind blows my ashes away.~
@1599 = ~Argh! I swear, when I am restored...!~
@1600 = ~You won't need me. But for now, you do. You accept that, I'll keep on standing by and being quiet and not making you feel less of a dragon for it. Agreed?~
@1601 = ~Silence. From you, a yes.~
@1602 = ~Moidre.~
@1603 = ~If you insist on...on clinging to me, then we shall have to find some way to fireproof you. Some specially enchanted armour, perhaps.~
@1604 = ~Pricey. You could learn to aim for free.~
@1605 = ~It will be worth the expense if I needn't restrain myself anymore.~
@1606 = ~Whose expense?~
@1607 = ~Yours.~
@1608 = ~...right.~
@1609 = ~*Obviously.*~
@1610 = ~Yeah, stupid question.~
@1611 = ~Are you well, my lady? I understand that travelling on foot can be tiring.~
@1612 = ~Mate, I am the last person here who'll take issue with tromping through the woods.~
@1613 = ~And you don't have to call me that. Just use my name.~
@1614 = ~Ah. Well...~
@1615 = ~Heh, "my lady." I dunno much about ladyship, but I'll bet anyone who says "ain't" don't qualify.~
@1616 = ~It's just that I'd feel awkward, my lady. I'm hardly your senior, and you're...I would not wish to talk down to you.~
@1617 = ~Ajantis. I was named Littlun by the people who saved my life, took me in and gave me everything I have. "My lady" does me less honour.~
@1618 = ~Oi, Shinytits! Give us a hand with the firewood.~
@1619 = ~Shiny...? Excuse me?~
@1620 = ~Tits. Shinytits. That's you. Here, split this up.~
@1621 = ~My lady, not to be rude, but I don't appreciate-~
@1622 = ~"My lady"? Who's that? Me?~
@1623 = ~Yeah. I'll be "my lady" if you want. But as long as I am, you're Shinytits. How's that?~
@1624 = ~My la...madam....that is not entirely fair. I only mean to show respect.~
@1625 = ~Sir Shinytits, then.~
@1626 = ~Which comes first, the man or the paladin?~
@1627 = ~I don't take your meaning, my la...Miss Plunkett.~
@1628 = ~I'm just thinking, were you always like this? All duty and honour? Or was it the call that did it? I'd like to think you were a little hellion at first.~
@1629 = ~I'm afraid I must disappoint you, then. It would be arrogance to say Helm did not change me for the better, but not so much as that.~
@1630 = ~Not even as a tyke? Knee-high? Never got up to nothing?~
@1631 = ~...well.~
@1632 = ~I knew it! I knew you were a bad'un! You can detect evil? Well I can detect mischief.~
@1633 = ~I'm sure I was no worse than any other boy of that age.~
@1634 = ~Oh, shut up. You're flesh and blood like the rest of us. I was starting to wonder, is all.~
@1635 = ~Gods, it's nice to have another midget here. Talking to all these lanky buggers was giving me a stiff neck.~
@1636 = ~Hah! Tall folk are great, though. Their pockets are always at juuust the right height.~
@1637 = ~You'll come a cropper one day with that.~
@1638 = ~Oh, it's happened before. No big fuss. I always slip away sooner or later.~
@1639 = ~I ain't talking about prison. There's bad people in the world, you know that? You take from them, they'll have you begging for a cell.~
@1640 = ~Aww, there's no such thing as bad people. Only grumpy ones. And I know just how to fix that!~
@1641 = ~I wish I had your faith. But if I did, I'd probably be dead. Maybe I just wish I had your life.~
@1642 = ~Oi! What are you doing?~
@1643 = ~Hold still, hold still! There's a twig stuck in your hair.~
@1644 = ~Oh, right.~
@1645 = ~Have you got it?~
@1646 = ~No, I'm fixing it. It looks good on you. Nice and woodsy.~
@1647 = ~Was it stuck or did you put it there?~
@1648 = ~That's not the question we need to ask right now. It's "Would another one be too much?"~
@1649 = ~Look, I don't need my head turned into a flamin' bird's nest. Leave it-~
@1650 = ~Oh, wow! Do you think we could really do that?~
@1651 = ~Wait, come back! There's some sparrows just there! C'mon! Littlun, c'mon. Littlun, you're a raaaanger.~
@1652 = ~Come on, let me try!~
@1653 = ~No. It's a weapon, alright? It ain't for playing with.~
@1654 = ~I won't hit anyone. I promise. I'll just shoot at some trees or something.~
@1655 = ~Are we fighting trees?~
@1656 = ~...no?~
@1657 = ~Then that's a waste of bolts, innit?~
@1658 = ~One shot. Just one.~
@1659 = ~Alora...~
@1660 = ~No, two. I wanna use the cranky lever thing.~
@1661 = ~Two. Under supervision. That is *it*. If you start whinging for more afterwards...~
@1662 = ~I won't. I won't, I won't, I swear I won't.~
@1663 = ~Here. Just, for gods' sakes, be careful.~
@1664 = ~You. Are. The best person. In the world.~
@1665 = ~Would that you'd been taken in by Tempus' followers, Littlun. Your skills would be the pride of the church.~
@1666 = ~I thought you lot were all up close and personal.~
@1667 = ~'Tis favoured, but not enforced. Archers belong in war as much as swordsmen.~
@1668 = ~And I have witnessed your spirit. If your crossbow were lost, you would take up a blade. If the blade were lost, you would make a fist. That is what defines a warrior. Not what you fight with; only that you do.~
@1669 = ~How about what you fight *for*? Does that matter?~
@1670 = ~Only that you do.~
@1671 = ~Wouldn't work for me, then.~
@1672 = ~So only men could be priests where you're from, yeah? That's why you left?~
@1673 = ~Aye, in brief.~
@1674 = ~Don't you think that's daft, though? Tempus obviously don't care. Why should they?~
@1675 = ~You speak true, my friend, but people do not always want the truth. I'll not contest a simple village tradition when there are greater battles to fight.~
@1676 = ~Well you should! Sail on back and bring a cargo of thumps for the lot of 'em. Ain't that what Tempus would want?~
@1677 = ~Hah! Perhaps. You are closer to him than you realise, I think.~
@1678 = ~Would you do the same to your tribesmen, if you could?~
@1679 = ~Well, no, but...that's different. I still respect 'em. I still love 'em.~
@1680 = ~All said and done, they didn't leave me. I left them.~
@1681 = ~Then it's not different.~
@1682 = ~So. Wyverns.~
@1683 = ~Indeed. Fine sport for such accomplished hunters as us, eh?~
@1684 = ~You know they're smart enough to talk? Only the dragon tongue, mind, but still.~
@1685 = ~More cunning than your average beast, to be sure, but no crude ambush will catch both your eyes and mine unawares. And as for our companions...ah, they'll catch on quick enough.~
@1686 = ~That ain't what I'm worried about.~
@1687 = ~You were told this wyvern was playing hell with the caravans, and it wouldn't surprise me if that were true. They're aggressive enough. But it also wouldn't surprise me if someone with more gold than brains looked at their mantelpiece one morning and thought "A wyvern head. That's just what I need."~
@1688 = ~Shooting a stag or a bear just for fun is one thing. I still don't approve, but it's one thing, and shooting something that knows how to speak is a very different thing. And if this turns out to be some toff compensating for his noodle...~
@1689 = ~Littlun. Perhaps your sylvan upbringing has impaired your judgement of such things, but Beregost is not that wealthy a place. If the mayor paid two thousand gold for a mere trophy, he'll soon be left with nowhere to mount it.~
@1690 = ~Don't call it sport, then. That's a life you're talking. Make sure it means something.~
@1691 = ~Littlun! Bring forth your cup and crossbow and let us settle who the better marksman is.~
@1692 = ~What's the cup for?~
@1693 = ~You miss, you drink.~
@1694 = ~Good point! You hit, you drink.~
@1695 = ~That's more like it.~
@1696 = ~So...who won?~
@1697 = ~I have no idea.~
@1698 = ~I think we switched. Didn't we? I took your bow and I couldn't draw it right, and that's why there's a big line of bruise on my chin.~
@1699 = ~Yes, and that gadget you wield was quite beyond me. Though after that much wine, my own fingers were beyond me.~
@1700 = ~Bit of an embarrassment all round.~
@1701 = ~Shall we try again tomorrow?~
@1702 = ~Yeah, alright.~
@1703 = ~Dear Littlun. Did winter winds creep up on us, or has our friendship grown chillier as of late?~
@1704 = ~What happens when Namara's old enough to say "Where's my dad?"~
@1705 = ~You think her mum will lie to spare her feelings? Say you died or went missing? Or maybe she'll tell the truth, that you're an irresponsible, selfish, flittering b-~
@1706 = ~Brielbara caught my interest for a time. It goes without saying that she is a beautiful and charming woman.~
@1707 = ~So?~
@1708 = ~So, I have faith she'll find a new suitor before the girl grows teeth, and the question will never arise.~
@1709 = ~Your daughter. Not "the girl." Your daughter.~
@1710 = ~No-one likes a pedant, Littlun.~
@1711 = ~No-one likes good-for-nothing fathers either.~
@1712 = ~I heard tell Rashemi witches all wore masks out and about. Is that just a folk tale, then? Or did you lose it?~
@1713 = ~Ah. 'Tis true we wear masks, but-~
@1714 = ~Bet them gnolls took it, didn't they? Mangy bastards.~
@1715 = ~Actually-~
@1716 = ~I can go back and find it for you. No trouble. It weren't that big a fort-~
@1717 = ~'Twas a half-truth you spoke. Only within the bounds of Rashemen do we don our masks.~
@1718 = ~'Tis unwise to flaunt status where it hath no weight.~
@1719 = ~Right.~
@1720 = ~You must have had some other kit though, yeah? Could have a poke about for that. If you want.~
@1721 = ~My thanks, but no.~
@1722 = ~Everything alright, Dynaheir? You need anything?~
@1723 = ~I am well enough, Littlun. Thank thee for inquiring.~
@1724 = ~You ain't tired or hungry or nothing? It's important to keep your strength up. Never know when you're in for a fight. You want some of my rations?~
@1725 = ~Really, Littlun, Minsc provides enough fuss. Thou needst not add to it. One would think 'twas thou who owed me the debt, and not I thee.~
@1726 = ~Really, Littlun, thou makest far too much fuss over my wellbeing. One would think 'twas thou who owed me the debt, and not I thee.~
@1727 = ~You owe <CHARNAME> a debt. All I did was make 'em angry.~
@1728 = ~Angry, yes, and cautious, and that made more difference than thou wouldst tell thyself.~
@1729 = ~Gnolls art not gracious hosts, as thou art well aware. They strove daily to erode my will, as they do with all their captives. But soon, whispers of the little huntress spread. They feared thee, grew ever more desperate to end your attacks, and could no longer spare the time for me. Every bolt you launched gave me a day's respite.~
@1730 = ~Perhaps 'twas <CHARNAME>'s aid that gave me freedom. But 'twas thine that kept my health. Had I been left to the spirit breakers, there would have been little left to save.~
@1731 = ~Come here, you.~
@1732 = ~Take your grubby hands off my robe! That fabric is worth more than your life!~
@1733 = ~Stop wearing it outside, then. Now listen. The time we spend travelling, we won't always be able to indulge Your Royal Highness with cushy inns. Now and again, we'll be bedding down under open sky.~
@1734 = ~That means gathering kindling, getting a fire going, finding something to eat. Cooking it if it needs it. How much of that can you handle?~
@1735 = ~I realise your ilk only recently discovered fire, but those of us who embraced evolution are quite familiar.~
@1736 = ~Yeah, so how do you arrange it? Where's the best place to start one? You think you can just chuck some wood on the ground and cast Wotsisface's Flaming Thumbtwiddles?~
@1737 = ~You've got brains. I'll give you that. But you can't eat scholarship and you can't warm your hands on it. You're in the wild now. Time someone showed you how to live in it.~
@1738 = ~Do you think I'd suffer your presence for even a moment if I had the *slightest* interest in campsite drudgery?~
@1739 = ~For someone who thinks cleverness is all that matters, you ain't much keen to learn.~
@1740 = ~A man learns from those above him, halfling. You have nothing to teach me. Now go fetch the sticks and I shall pat your head, as good little dogs deserve.~
@1741 = ~Anything happens to Dynaheir and you're a dead man.~
@1742 = ~Understand, if you can, that I do not take kindly to threats. Particularly from the diminutive.~
@1743 = ~You'll take whatever I give you and then some. I did not drag her out of that fortress just to lose her 'cause of some Red Wanker of Who-Gives-A-Toss.~
@1744 = ~What is it that compels fools to meddle in the affairs of their betters? Do you know the nature of this conflict? If I struck her down, would you even stop to ask why?~
@1745 = ~Oh, now you're talking about doing her in personally. That's a different kettle of fish.~
@1746 = ~See, I don't just want you to leave her alone. I want you to do your part, as a member of this group, to keep her alive. Same as you do for us. ~
@1747 = ~*Anything* happens to her, any little "accidents" where you forget to cover her or toss her a potion when she needs one, you're a dead man. Kill her yourself? You're a dead eunuch.~
@1748 = ~Gawds' sakes Eldoth, play something nice or give it a rest.~
@1749 = ~And what, in your no doubt expert opinion, would "something nice" entail?~
@1750 = ~Something that don't make me want to tie myself a noose. Your company's plenty misery. Least you could do is balance it out.~
@1751 = ~If you want some childish jingle to put a spring in your step, I suggest you ask someone with less appreciation for the craft. Perhaps we can find a doting mother to sing you the alphabet.~
@1752 = ~If you're so bloody talented then why ain't you living off it? Why not sell music to a crowd instead of selling little girls back to their dads?~
@1753 = ~Alas, little girls are more appreciated alive. The greatest artists are not.~
@1754 = ~I can help with that.~
@1755 = ~Are you going to kill that rabbit or not?~
@1756 = ~No! I'm trying to help it. All scratched up, the poor sod.~
@1757 = ~Let me see.~
@1758 = ~Hmm. Talon wounds. A hawk has left its mark.~
@1759 = ~There is no need to interfere. If it succumbs, it will be a natural death. ~
@1760 = ~Yeah, well, the hawk's gone, we've all eaten, and I'm not letting it suffer for nothing.~
@1761 = ~It must survive on its own! Carrying the injuries will strengthen it.~
@1762 = ~OW! How dare you?!~
@1763 = ~Carry it. Grow stronger. Bugger off.~
@1764 = ~I met a woodsman, you know. Just before <CHARNAME> came along. Caught him about to go through an oak with a rusty old hatchet. About to try, anyway.~
@1765 = ~I hope you showed him his error.~
@1766 = ~Yeah, but not the way you mean. I taught him how to look for dead wood. And I didn't give him grief about respecting nature or anything like that. I just said, that'll burn easier, it'll split easier, and you're doing less harm. And he thanked me and went home without hurting a single tree.~
@1767 = ~Hmph.~
@1768 = ~You reckon that's a bad ending, then?~
@1769 = ~You meant well, but good intentions aren't enough. The man likely felled a dozen saplings the moment your back was turned.~
@1770 = ~Why? Why would he do that? Even if he were completely selfish, he'd have no reason. I told him why dead wood was better.~
@1771 = ~"Civilised" folk are vindictive creatures.~
@1772 = ~Some of 'em, yeah. And some of 'em are alright.~
@1773 = ~And while you decide which is which, they are free to sow as much destruction as they please.~
@1774 = ~And while you decide to kill 'em all, you get maybe one bastard who deserved it for every dozen poor sods who didn't know any better!~
@1775 = ~Is that unacceptable to you?~
@1776 = ~You are off your bleedin' rocker! The whole lot of you!~
@1777 = ~Garrick, your cock is crooked.~
@1778 = ~I beg your pardon?!~
@1779 = ~Your crossbow. You ain't cocking it right. Too much tension on one side, see? It'll throw the bolt off.~
@1780 = ~Oh...my crossbow. Of course.~
@1781 = ~Not that I don't like a song, but this ain't a stage. Maybe spend a bit more time with this string and a bit less with the others, yeah?~
@1782 = ~Yes, certainly. Hah, thank goodness. I thought you meant...~
@1783 = ~Er, nothing. Thank you for the advice. I'll just...~
@1784 = ~Straighten your cock?~
@1785 = ~(Heh.)~
@1786 = ~Garrick, listen. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but are you sure you should be here?~
@1787 = ~Perfectly sure! I can hardly record adventures I haven't witnessed.~
@1788 = ~Yeah, "adventure" is all well and good, but we're raising hackles on some big dogs here. Wolves. Once they have your scent, they won't forget it.~
@1789 = ~If you'll forgive a moment of vanity, I think I've handled myself well enough so far.~
@1790 = ~Of course you have, but you still ain't a fighter. You're an actor, a musician and...well, a city boy. That's not an insult, it's just what you are.~
@1791 = ~And if a fighter dies in a fight, that's what happens to fighters. Can't be helped. When actors and musicians die in fights, that's what the fighters are meant to stop.~
@1792 = ~Surely you aren't saying you want me to leave.~
@1793 = ~I'm saying...I don't know what I'm saying. I just don't want you getting yourself killed.~
@1794 = ~Well, quite! Nor do I. So naturally, I shall stay among those I trust to protect me.~
@1795 = ~As we were, then?~
@1796 = ~<CHARNAME> was saying <PRO_HESHE> can't get into Candlekeep no more. Does that mean you can't either?~
@1797 = ~"Hold travellers! Before yew are allowed entreh, yew must dohnate a tohme of greht velyew to our librehrehs."~
@1798 = ~Uh, no. I can't. Not without one of their precious books.~
@1799 = ~Don't that bother you? I mean, <PRO_HESHE> had to leave. You could've stayed.~
@1800 = ~Sure, but then <PRO_HESHE>  would've been cryin' <PRO_HIMHER>self to sleep every night with an Imoen-shaped hole in <PRO_HIMHER>. Couldn't have that.~
@1801 = ~Besides, look what ended up happening. I chose right, don't you think?~
@1802 = ~I do. Just wondered if you did too.~
@1803 = ~Stay low!~
@1804 = ~I am! I can't get lower than this!~
@1805 = ~Yeah you can. You just don't want to get the muck on you. Down you come.~
@1806 = ~Ugh.~
@1807 = ~Better than being spotted, believe me. Dirt comes out easier than blood.~
@1808 = ~You're worth teaching, I reckon. We've been at this a good while, and I ain't once heard "Oh, you're only better at hiding 'cause you're short."~
@1809 = ~Hey, you can whine or you can practice. Only one's gonna get you somewhere.~
@1810 = ~Besides, you're not better than me! We're just in your neighbourhood. Wait 'til it's time for sneakin' in a library, then we'll see who needs lessons.~
@1811 = ~Oh yeah. I bet it's hard going, slipping past some half-blind old codgers.~
@1812 = ~Excuse me. Some of 'em are half-*deaf*. The trick is knowing who's what.~
@1813 = ~What do you make of this Bhaalspawn business?~
@1814 = ~...I dunno. I really don't. If it hadn't come from old Gorion, I wouldn't even believe it.~
@1815 = ~So you had no idea? He never said nothing to you?~
@1816 = ~Me? I wasn't even s'posed to know he and <CHARNAME> were leaving. You think he'd let *that* slip?~
@1817 = ~It's just...<CHARNAME> gets bundled off to Candlekeep and has to spend <PRO_HISHER> whole life there. Never finds out why until now. Then *you* get bundled off to Candlekeep...~
@1818 = ~Oh. Oh, no way. Can't be. I haven't had the nightmares or gotten any weird powers or...anything that <CHARNAME>'s been through.~
@1819 = ~Besides, Gorion would've said. Wouldn't he? If he'd known. He'd have said so in the letter.~
@1820 = ~Yeah, alright, alright. Just me overthinking it, then. ~
@1821 = ~Do you have a guardian, Jaheira? A spirit animal?~
@1822 = ~Perhaps. If I do, it has not made its presence known.~
@1823 = ~The wild elves, when they grow up, they have a special ceremony to help them find theirs. Herbs and meditation and all that. I'd've thought druids do something too.~
@1824 = ~It depends on the order. There are those who feel more in tune with plant life than animal, or who revere the elements themselves. Many traditions. But I believe one may find a friend in any aspect of nature, if one searches.~
@1825 = ~What is yours like?~
@1826 = ~Oh, I ain't got one. I mean, I couldn't have. I wasn't an elf. Wouldn't have worked.~
@1827 = ~That was the reason? They told you this?~
@1828 = ~Not to my face, but...~
@1829 = ~Then perhaps you merely left before it came to you.~
@1830 = ~...I'd want a badger, I think. Or a wolverine. Something like that.~
@1831 = ~Indeed. Something small, but fierce. Something that people underestimate.~
@1832 = ~You ever wonder what it'd be like growing up in the city? How you'd have turned out?~
@1833 = ~"What if?" is a question for the unhappy and the uncertain. I am neither.~
@1834 = ~Yeah, fair enough. Me, I can't help it sometimes.~
@1835 = ~This crossbow didn't come from the wild. When you're carrying a piece of who you might've been, it's hard not to think about it.~
@1836 = ~And whom might you have been?~
@1837 = ~A posh twit who went on hunting trips in a bright red coat, and could shoot a dozen gnolls dead before the rest figured out which way to run.~
@1838 = ~Ah. So you aren't *wishing* it had been different, as such. ~
@1839 = ~I dunno. So far I can only do half a dozen. Might be worth the trade.~
@1840 = ~I could use someone like you, Littlun. Caravans pay extra for archers. Keeps the tussle away from the goods.~
@1841 = ~What, you mean a job? Mercenary work?~
@1842 = ~Why not? Ain't different from what you're doing now, save a steadier salary.~
@1843 = ~Sounds like I'd be planting my feet, though. Too much wild in me to do that. I'd go mental.~
@1844 = ~Too much *elf* in you, you mean. Left you no stomach for an honest day's work.~
@1845 = ~Honest? Catching your supper is honest work. Building a shelter is honest work. Only time work turns dishonest is when there's money in it.~
@1846 = ~And speak ill of my people again, I'll give your goods a bleedin' tussle.~
@1847 = ~Damn forests.~
@1848 = ~Oh, shut up. Grumpy old git. Take the helmet off and feel the wind.~
@1849 = ~I know what the damn wind feels like.~
@1850 = ~No you don't. It's different out here. Fresher. Peaceful. There's nothing in the world'll clear your head like the sound of wind on leaves. Just close your eyes and listen for a minute.~
@1851 = ~*blaaaaart*~
@1852 = ~Yeah, you're right. That does feel better.~
@1853 = ~Sut naa lle umien, Khalid?~
@1854 = ~P-pardon?~
@1855 = ~Oh. You don't speak elven?~
@1856 = ~Ah. Only a little, I'm afraid. M-my father didn't want me exploring that side of my heritage. It was all he could to not to have my ears trimmed. ~
@1857 = ~Heh. Fine pair we are, then. Elf who don't speak elven and a halfling who don't speak halfling. ~
@1858 = ~I'm only half-elf, you understand.~
@1859 = ~Still. Better half-elf than half...ling.~
@1860 = ~Littlun, you mustn't think like that. I know it's hard b-being the odd one out, but "odd" doesn't mean "lesser", no matter how much it might feel that way.~
@1861 = ~When I was growing up, there were times my father would pretend I didn't exist. I'd p-pass him in the halls and he'd fix his gaze ahead. At mealtimes, he'd have a t-table set for four...himself, his wife, and my two half-brothers. And he knew I wouldn't have the c-courage to make myself heard.~
@1862 = ~Those days, I would kneel down and ask the gods @324 /* Why? */ And then I met Jaheira, and I knew they had answered.~
@1863 = ~Mani naa essa en lle?~
@1864 = ~Nin essa Khalid, a im onnan min Calimshan.~
@1865 = ~"My name is Khalid and I was baked in Calimshan?"~
@1866 = ~Oh. I-is that what I said?~
@1867 = ~*Onnen* min Calimshan.~
@1868 = ~Nin essa Khalid, a im onnen min Calimshan.~
@1869 = ~You know what? You don't stutter when you speak elven.~
@1870 = ~D-don't I?~
@1871 = ~Say it again.~
@1872 = ~My name is Khalid and I was b-born in...hmm.~
@1873 = ~Told you. You're an elf.~
@1874 = ~Khalid, you and Jaheira make a lovely couple. And I know I ain't sticking around here forever, so I want to wish you both the best.~
@1875 = ~T-thank you very much. And the same to you, of course.~
@1876 = ~That said, I hope you won't take it wrong when I say she's lucky she found you first.~
@1877 = ~So are you, actually. I ain't as gentle as she is.~
@1878 = ~Ha ha! Jaheira's gentle, is she?~
@1879 = ~'Course. She just don't want people knowing.~
@1880 = ~You've trained your eyes well.~
@1881 = ~Aa' menle nauva calen ar' ta hwesta e' ale'quenle, Kivan.~
@1882 = ~Didn't know I knew that, did you?~
@1883 = ~Well spoken indeed. I could close my eyes and mistake you for kin.~
@1884 = ~Practically my first language, but I hardly get to speak it no more. Keep me straight, yeah? Don't want to outgrow my roots.~
@1885 = ~The Sy-tel-quessir dialect lingers still. You needn't worry.~
@1886 = ~Wish I could handle a longbow like that.~
@1887 = ~Take pride in what skill you have, Littlun. It is more than enough.~
@1888 = ~Who taught you to shoot?~
@1889 = ~Ah, everyone and no-one. Got the stance and the focus from the tribe, and the rest was just practice. Day and night, 'till my fingers bled.~
@1890 = ~It shows. Your hands are more rawhide than skin.~
@1891 = ~Hah, they had to tell me off about it too. Got so's you couldn't find one bit of fruit for leagues without a bolt through it. Some of 'em took to calling me Caryavendengin.~
@1892 = ~Appleslayer?~
@1893 = ~Yep.~
@1894 = ~Kivan. Just want you to know, I'll be keeping an eye out for this Tazok.~
@1895 = ~If I find the bastard, he's yours. ~
@1896 = ~There is no more I could ask, Littlun, and no more you could give.~
@1897 = ~Just run it by me again. This is a miniature...?~
@1898 = ~A miniature giant space hamster!~
@1899 = ~So there are non-miniature giant space hamsters too.~
@1900 = ~Oh yes. Bigger even than Minsc, I hear, though I have not had the honour of meeting one.~
@1901 = ~And Boo don't mind being the smaller type?~
@1902 = ~Not at all. His tininess is a point of pride! And it is fortunate for Minsc, for he is much easier to carry this way.~
@1903 = ~I suppose there's a lesson in that, then.~
@1904 = ~Ooh! We must find you a regular giant space hamster. A mount and companion for you, and a friend for Boo!~
@1905 = ~I'll...keep an eye out.~
@1906 = ~Ah, Boo, we could not ask for better company than this! You and I, Littlun, we are death to our foes from near and far! Dynaheir has never been so safe, and evil never so cowed!~
@1907 = ~...yeah.~
@1908 = ~What's this? I meant to bring smiles and the patting of backs! Have I put words before thought?~
@1909 = ~Minsc, listen. The day'll come when you're off home to Rashemen, and I won't be able to go with you. So you and Boo look after her, alright? Someone has to survive.~
@1910 = ~Survive? We shall all survive! Minsc will see to it!~
@1911 = ~I meant...never mind. Just keep her alive, you pillock. And yourself.~
@1912 = ~I see that contraption o' yers pointed my way more'n I care to.~
@1913 = ~And I pull the trigger less often than I care to. Any guff from you or your mate and you'll both cop an eyeful.~
@1914 = ~Be that a threat?~
@1915 = ~Huh. 'Tis more the nature o' yer kind to answer with a dance. "Oh, no threat good sir, merely take note that ye be watched."~
@1916 = ~Let that be a warning, then. I don't muck about.~
@1917 = ~Now we've cleared up the mines, ain't it time you went on your way? Or are you gonna pretend you're here for kindness' sake?~
@1918 = ~Aye, we smashed the puppets. Now we follow the strings and sever the fingers. Anything less be a job half done.~
@1919 = ~How's this? You tell us where to meet you, and once we've sorted it out, we'll come back and give you the whole story. I'll even tuck you in afterwards. ~
@1920 = ~Yer keen to hear my goodbyes. Tired of finding knives in yer enemies' backs?~
@1921 = ~I'd rather be with useless friends than useful cutthroats.~
@1922 = ~Suit yerself. Spare ye a lonesome grave, at least.~
@1923 = ~Quite a fine weapon you have there, Littlun.~
@1924 = ~Cheers.~
@1925 = ~Mind you, it's practically crude compared to the works of Lantan. Why, last I visited, they had crossbows that could launch an entire case of bolts in seconds.~
@1926 = ~Yeah, those are siege weapons. Might as well ask why I don't use a ballista.~
@1927 = ~Well, true, but-~
@1928 = ~They ain't "bows" either. No string, no arc. All steam and springs or some guff. And, dunno if you heard this bit, but they ain't ever been used 'cause they have this thing where they blow up.~
@1929 = ~If you want to show me a crossbow that shoots as fast as this, as true as this, one you can carry around and that don't use magic to do any of it, I'm one big ear for you. Till then?~
@1930 = ~Stuff it.~
@1931 = ~How, may I ask, did you come by the details of Lantanese prototypes?~
@1932 = ~It's all in the manuscript my dad wrote. I've read every page.~
@1933 = ~Ah. And your father would have spent time in Lantan to learn such things. No doubt he stood at the forefront of his craft.~
@1934 = ~He did.~
@1935 = ~So it's little surprise that his knowledge of ballistics would exceed mine. A gnome can't be an expert in *every* discipline. And of course he passed that knowledge on to you, so-~
@1936 = ~Look, you probably know more things than I do, alright? Just not about crossbows.~
@1937 = ~Yes! Exactly.~
@1938 = ~Incidentally, are you at all familiar with the migratory patterns of the aarakocra?~
@1939 = ~No, Quayle. That Sounds Fascinating. Tell Me More.~
@1940 = ~Show me your hands, Littlun.~
@1941 = ~What for?~
@1942 = ~Just indulge me.~
@1943 = ~As I thought, coarse as bark. Try soaking in hot water and honey. It'll soften those calluses.~
@1944 = ~What the blithering hell do I want soft skin for? Or sweet fingers?~
@1945 = ~Because, dear, when you touch a man's face, they do not appreciate having the skin of their cheek rasped away. And as for sweet fingers, well...~
@1946 = ~Tough hands don't bleed. If a bloke don't like it, he can grow a beard.~
@1947 = ~Ah, but Littlun, when a lady's on the prowl, it pays to be a little...flexible.~
@1948 = ~Sod that. If someone don't want what I am, I ain't giving 'em something else.~
@1949 = ~Who's on the prowl anyway? Where's that coming from?~
@1950 = ~How long has it been?~
@1951 = ~None of your flamin' business!~
@1952 = ~I'm trying to teach you something. You do understand that?~
@1953 = ~There ain't nothing about men I need to learn from you.~
@1954 = ~Darling, there is more than I'd live long enough to tell. If nothing else, you must realise it is not wrong to take advantage of your womanhood. Your prey gets what he wants as much as you do.~
@1955 = ~I don't need my "womanhood" to get what I want.~
@1956 = ~And what exactly do you want?~
@1957 = ~You don't know? There's your problem, then. A girl must always know what she-~
@1958 = ~I want to fix the bloody world, Safana.~
@1959 = ~How's that? Any tips? Bit of nail polish do the trick, maybe?~
@1960 = ~Oh, my poor, dear friend. The world can't be fixed. All we can do is enjoy the good parts.~
@1961 = ~I swear, if that bastard leers at me one more time...~
@1962 = ~Yes, that's right. Pretend you were looking at something else, coward. Typical man.~
@1963 = ~Gawd, give over. Only reason you're here is 'cause you got a man's bootprint on your arse, so they can't be that rubbish.~
@1964 = ~Carelessness! If I'd actually been trying...~
@1965 = ~So try again, then. Have another fight for your freedom and do it proper.~
@1966 = ~You think I hadn't thought of that? The problem is getting them to agree to it. I have nothing more to wager. Nothing I'm willing to offer, at least.~
@1967 = ~You could promise to stop going on about men. I reckon that'd do.~
@1968 = ~Like I said, nothing I'm willing to offer.~
@1969 = ~You'd be better with a sword in your hand, Littlun. It serves you nothing to shy away from the front.~
@1970 = ~I can knock some heads about if I have to. But if I've got a crossbow and they don't, ain't much sense closing the distance, is there?~
@1971 = ~It's not a matter of *sense*, woman. Your little bolts will never be as satisfying as wading into a good brawl, skewering-~
@1972 = ~Yeah yeah, splittin' someone's skull in half, splattering his brains on your face, carving the still-warm such-and-such from his etcetera.~
@1973 = ~Heavens above. *I'm* the shortarse here. I should be the one with something to prove.~
@1974 = ~Skie, when are you going home?~
@1975 = ~I'm not. My home is on the road now. With Eldoth.~
@1976 = ~No. No no no. I've bitten my tongue long enough. You do not belong out here and you do not belong with him.~
@1977 = ~Let's say something happens to you. How are we supposed to tell your dad? "Oh yeah, I know you thought she just ran off for a lark, but actually she was helping us destroy the Iron Throne and we let her snuff it. Sorry."~
@1978 = ~Who said you need to tell him anything? I never asked you to do that.~
@1979 = ~So you're going to let him wonder about you for the rest of his life. Just 'cause he made you angry.~
@1980 = ~...he shouldn't have been so overbearing.~
@1981 = ~Alright. I know you like to make your own decisions, so here's how we'll do this.~
@1982 = ~After this, you're going home. No arguing. But, and here's where you get to choose, you can go on your feet or in a sack.~
@1983 = ~You can't just decide that for me! You're not my mother!~
@1984 = ~No. I ain't. And that's the thing. Your mother wouldn't hogtie you and chuck you in a wagon.~
@1985 = ~I would.~
@1986 = ~Archeress! From this day forth, you walk on your knees or lose your shins! It is a cruel, mad world where even the short are taller than Tiax!~
@1987 = ~Turns out I missed the half in halfling, eh? Comes of being raised by elves, I reckon. Spend your life on tiptoe and the rest of you takes the hint.~
@1988 = ~You have no right! When the day comes, Tiax's sweeping scythe shall split the big folk in two and dash the top off your head in boiled-egg fashion!~
@1989 = ~I didn't grow to spite you, mate. And whinging won't make you bigger.~
@1990 = ~Here, chew on this. Back in my tribe, there was an archer got his legs smashed by gnolls. Pulp. Magic got the blood stopped, but we couldn't make him walk. He weren't no taller than you after that, counting the bits that still worked.~
@1991 = ~Hmph. Then perhaps he would understand Tiax's plight.~
@1992 = ~Yeah. And he could've complained about it. Cursed the world, cursed how unfair it was. He'd every right to. But you know what he did instead?~
@1993 = ~He learned to shoot sideways.~
@1994 = ~What happened to your family, Tiax? Do you still see 'em?~
@1995 = ~Tiax has forsaken such earthly ties in preparation for his ascension. None shall call him son or brother. Only king.~
@1996 = ~So you do have brothers and sisters? Your parents are still alive somewhere?~
@1997 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps not.~
@1998 = ~Think hard. You're sure there's no-one you can go back to? No-one who can...you know, have a word with you?~
@1999 = ~Enough. When Tiax rules, such nosiness will be punishable by maiming.~
@2000 = ~Tiax. You're bonkers. You're completely bonkers and you need help. If there is any part of you that remembers the life you had before Cyric, tell me, 'cause your brain's smashed to bits and I don't know which piece to pick up first.~
@2001 = ~You want to help Tiax? Then help him claim his throne! Nothing less is worthy of Tiax! NOTHING ELSE MATTERS!~
@2002 = ~You'll see. One day, you'll all see, and you will rue your doubt.~
@2003 = ~That officer said you killed a farmer and his family.~
@2004 = ~Did you?~
@2005 = ~I offered you my services, not my past. The deed is done and I am here. Nothing else concerns you.~
@2006 = ~So you come begging to us for help, make us fight the law for you, then you can't even be bothered to tell us we did the right thing.~
@2007 = ~...if you distrust me enough to ask, it doesn't matter how I answer.~
@2008 = ~Look. You're a drow. You've murdered. I know you've done it and I know you don't think much of doing it.~
@2009 = ~So if I know that, and I'm still asking if you killed those people, then yeah. It does matter how you answer.~
@2010 = ~They deserved it. All of them.~
@2011 = ~I hope to gods they did, Viconia.~
@2012 = ~So, sakphul. I hear the surface elves adopted you.~
@2013 = ~What about it?~
@2014 = ~Nothing in particular, but it's quite the picture. A squealing, stunted babe, left to die in the woods and rescued by a tribe of *darthiir*, of all people. I can't imagine anything more pathetic.~
@2015 = ~You agree?~
@2016 = ~What am I supposed to say? I ain't in the mood to encourage you.~
@2017 = ~So yeah. Fine. I'm pathetic. Whatever you say.~
@2018 = ~Hmph. If not pathetic, then certainly dull.~
@2019 = ~Tell me true, Littlun. What ghastly stories do the darthiir spin of my people?~
@2020 = ~Why? So you can pretend they're all lies?~
@2021 = ~You believe them, then? Typical. I'd hoped to hear some unbiased insight for once.~
@2022 = ~Doubt me if it comforts your narrow mind, but history is always written by the victors, and your precious tribesmen are no exception. They will vilify us as much as necessary to justify-~
@2023 = ~Dear gods and all that's holy, spare me this woman's bloody moaning.~
@2024 = ~Yeah, they told me stories. How you betrayed your kin out of spite. How you don't have a word for "friend", or "love." You want to change my mind? Prove 'em wrong.~
@2025 = ~All I know about you is you killed a family of people because they "deserved it", and you like being a spiteful old bitch for no reason. And you're one that *don't* worship the Spider Queen. So if the stories ain't true, stop telling me and start showing me.~
@2026 = ~And what would you have me do, then? Make shows of benevolence? Smile and sympathise with those who call for my head?~
@2027 = ~I would have you make your sodding mind up. Either you don't care what people say about drow and you should stop complaining, or you do, and you should start changing it. PICK ONE.~
@2028 = ~How fare the Sy-tel-quessir, Littlun? We hear less and less over the years.~
@2029 = ~Ah, I wouldn't worry. You know how they are. If they ain't talking, all's well.~
@2030 = ~"They"?~
@2031 = ~I would have expected you to say "we."~
@2032 = ~I ain't one of 'em, Xan.~
@2033 = ~True, but it has not been that long since you left. Surely the habit lingers.~
@2034 = ~It's never been a habit. I'm a halfling. I'm smaller than any elf. I ain't as pretty as any elf. I'll die ten times sooner than any elf.~
@2035 = ~It's "they". Always has been.~
@2036 = ~I think you're mistaken about one thing, Littlun. True, you are smaller than any elf, and perhaps not as beautiful. But I do not believe you will die sooner than any elf.~
@2037 = ~Certainly not me, at least.~
@2038 = ~I'm confused. Are you trying to cheer me up, or what?~
@2039 = ~I don't quite know. Perhaps.~
@2040 = ~"Don't worry, we're *all* doomed. Not just you." That's you being inspirational.~
@2041 = ~Apparently.~
@2042 = ~Bloody hell, Xan.~
@2043 = ~Monty! Monty! Come quickly! I've found you a wife!~
@2044 = ~If you're talking about me, I'll bloody well strangle you.~
@2045 = ~A bit rough, perhaps, but...ah, you've always liked that, haven't you?~
@2046 = ~Come, little ones! I should like to dress you up and make you kiss.~
@2047 = ~I should like to put a bolt in your skull, 'cause it can't be worse than what's there now!~
@2048 = ~Best ye pay no mind. The more ye argue, the longer he goes.~
@2049 = ~We are gathered here today...~
@2050 = ~Psst! Littlun!~
@2051 = ~*What.*~
@2052 = ~Kill me.~
@2053 = ~...eh?~
@2054 = ~Kill. Me. Kill me.~
@2055 = ~What are you doing? What is this?~
@2056 = ~It's what you want.~
@2057 = ~I've seen how you look at me. You want me gone. Me and Montaron both. You can't have him, but I'll give you me. Do it. Do it quickly.~
@2058 = ~Here. This is where the heart is. Mine's black, they say, but you can pierce it just the same. ~
@2059 = ~Stop it. Just...go away. I ain't doing this.~
@2060 = ~Why not? Why? You want to! I'm a horrible, nasty man and I deserve it!~
@2061 = ~I ain't just gonna put you down, alright? Not like some rabid dog. You're still a person.~
@2062 = ~Damn you. DAMN YOU.~
@2063 = ~Montyyy! Kill me! I need to be a zombie!~
@2064 = ~No!~
@2065 = ~I'll nay speak of yer strife with the elves, Littlun, but ye'd be more'n welcome among dwarfkin, if ever you've a mind. 'Specially with such craft to offer.~
@2066 = ~What, crossbows? I only use 'em, though. Ain't made any myself.~
@2067 = ~But I've seen ye tinker. Ye know the workings, aye? All the bits and bolts?~
@2068 = ~Keeping something in good nick ain't the same as building it. Come on, you're a smith. You know that.~
@2069 = ~How old be that weapon?~
@2070 = ~Er, I dunno. Older than me. Used it...maybe fifteen years?~
@2071 = ~If ye made me guess, I'd be sayin' it were fresh off the lathe. That ain't maintenance, lass. That's magic.~
@2072 = ~It's...it's just the workmanship. I mean, it's built to last. My dad was the best.~
@2073 = ~Aye, nay doubt, nor that ye could be better still. But not till ye stop puttin' yerself in people's shadows.~
@2074 = ~What's that yer whittlin' at, Littlun?~
@2075 = ~It's a crossbow stock. After what you were telling me before, I thought, you know. No harm giving it a go.~
@2076 = ~How's it comin'?~
@2077 = ~It's...~
@2078 = ~It's hard. It's bloody hard. But I'm doing it.~
@2079 = ~Aye. Just how anything of worth gets done.~
@2080 = ~I understand how to put the bits together. It's just a matter of actually making the bits. Maybe you could show me how to do the metalwork?~
@2081 = ~Back to smithing, is it? Aye, gladly. I've nay had the pride of taking an apprentice since...~
@2082 = ~Beg pardon. Some aches dinnae fade quickly.~
@2083 = ~Remember you said the dwarves would have me? Did you really mean that or were you just being nice?~
@2084 = ~They'd have ye, sure as stone. Honest, hardworking lass, an' a good head on yer shoulders that won't bump the ceilin'. Ye'd fit like ye was born there, if ye'd not miss yer trees too much. ~
@2085 = ~Who would I go to, though? I mean, your clan's all...~
@2086 = ~Oh gods, I'm sorry. That slipped out.~
@2087 = ~Nay, it be a fair point. Truth be told, I left for Sembia after the flood, tried to put it out of me head, but it were more out of grief than sense. Mayhap I'll seek them that survived, an' we'll see about a new home for ourselves. A proper dwarfhome.~
@2088 = ~If you do, tell me. I'll help. Dunno about settling, but I'll help.~
@2089 = ~An' that's why I know ye'd be welcome.~
@2090 = ~I didn't think dwarves went walkabout like this.~
@2091 = ~Didn't think halflings did either.~
@2092 = ~Homegrown halflings don't.~
@2093 = ~Maybe I'm not a homegrown dwarf.~
@2094 = ~No? If that's true, I'd never have guessed. You act like one.~
@2095 = ~Do I?~
@2096 = ~Uh...dunno, actually. I've hardly met any. Elves and dwarves, you know. They don't mix.~
@2097 = ~Don't they?~
@2098 = ~...startin' to feel like maybe I ain't seen enough of the world.~
@2099 = ~Better than feeling like you have.~
@2100 = ~Smell that? Juniper.~
@2101 = ~Not familiar.~
@2102 = ~It's a tree, Moidre.~
@2103 = ~Mm. Rare thing to see in a cavern. Or smell.~
@2104 = ~One of the strongest woods for bowmaking. A good juniper arc will draw smooth as oil and put a shaft clean through steel plate.~
@2105 = ~Plenty of flavour in the fruit, too. You can make some right fine firewater from a juniper berry. And the leaves and bark are good for all kinds of medicine.  We prized 'em more than any other tree.~
@2106 = ~Always takes me home, that smell. Every full moon, the elders would sit everyone by the fire with their censers of burning juniper oil, and we'd close our eyes and sing the old songs for the spirits of the wood, and for all the elves that came before us...~
@2107 = ~*sigh* I could be there now. That's mad, isn't it? One different turn at the crossroads and I'd home right as I say this, with all the things I grew to know. Instead I'm here with you and <CHARNAME>, living another person's life.~
@2108 = ~If you've made so few bad decisions that fixing just one would change everything, you're doing better than me.~
@2109 = ~I been thinking. Maybe I should head to Gullykin after this.~
@2110 = ~Settling down already?~
@2111 = ~Nah. Just want a place to go back to every now and then.~
@2112 = ~You could come. If you wanted.~
@2113 = ~Doubt they'd have me.~
@2114 = ~They would, for three reasons. First, you and me put that ogre in the dirt for 'em. Second, little towns with little walls don't turn away big people with big shields.~
@2115 = ~Third, anyone says no and they'll catch a bad case of black eye.~
@2116 = ~Why do that for me?~
@2117 = ~Why wouldn't I?~
@2118 = ~Because...~
@2119 = ~Can't be as many reasons as you think, if it takes that long to find one.~
@2120 = ~You handle your shield remarkably, sir dwarf. If I may, I would like to study your technique. ~
@2121 = ~Lady dwarf.~
@2122 = ~Oh...oh, I apologise. I thought-~
@2123 = ~Want to hold a shield like I do? Lesson one: The shield is more important than you.~
@2124 = ~You're just meat and bone. The shield is strong. The shield protects. You're only good for putting it where it needs to be. Understand?~
@2125 = ~I...think so.~
@2126 = ~Not good enough. But we'll get you there.~
@2127 = ~Which arm is this?~
@2128 = ~Left?~
@2129 = ~No. This is your shield arm. And it's crippled.~
@2130 = ~You pick up a shield, your arm feels heavier than normal. Right?~
@2131 = ~Of course, but-~
@2132 = ~That's backwards. Should feel lighter than normal when you put it down.~
@2133 = ~Get yourself the biggest, thickest slab of steel you can find and don't let go. No matter what you're doing, no matter how much it hurts. You keep your hold until you can't feel your fingers anymore.~
@2134 = ~My lady, with all due respect, I can't possibly carry a shield all day.~
@2135 = ~Yet.~
@2136 = ~No, I mean it would get in the way. How am I to sit at a table, or remove my armour, or...?~
@2137 = ~Lesson one.~
@2138 = ~Moidre, I...I thank you for your instruction. But I fear these lessons were not meant for me to learn. I would gladly give my life for another's, but I would do so knowing it was still a loss.~
@2139 = ~If Helm did not see worth in me, he would not have chosen me. To deny that is to deny him, and lose everything I am.~
@2140 = ~Then Helm is your shield. That's what you carry every day. That's what makes you a paladin.~
@2141 = ~Some of us only have a wooden board between us and the world. You, you've got your god, your faith, and your honour. Never needed anything from me.~
@2142 = ~Do not discredit yourself, my lady. You have taught me something. It merely wasn't what you intended.~
@2143 = ~Blah!~
@2144 = ~Bleeeeeh!~
@2145 = ~Bloogabloogablooga!~
@2146 = ~You realise even if you did get me to smile, you wouldn't see it.~
@2147 = ~I'd feel it, Moidre. I can always feel a smile.~
@2148 = ~Hee hee. Look at this, Moidre. I can squeeze in behind your shield, and...poof! I'm invisible!~
@2149 = ~Now take me somewhere. Take me...I know! There's this huge mansion in Baldur's Gate I could never sneak into. You could get a job as a night guard, smuggle me in...~
@2150 = ~Nobles wouldn't have me.~
@2151 = ~What? Why not? You're super good at guarding things. Behind you is the safest place in the world.~
@2152 = ~Doesn't matter. Nobles want tall men in shiny armour who can stand up straight and say "Yes, milord." Fighting comes second.~
@2153 = ~I'm just good at cracking heads. Different sort of person hires me, and they don't have houses you want to be in.~
@2154 = ~Thanks, Moidre.~
@2155 = ~For what?~
@2156 = ~Just for keeping us all safe and working so hard and always listening to me and...everything. Thanks.~
@2157 = ~Hah! There it is! Felt it!~
@2158 = ~Something in my teeth.~
@2159 = ~Moidre, I have never heard so hardy a warrior so quiet! Give us a battlecry! With me, now!~
@2160 = ~GRRAAAAAHHHH!~
@2161 = ~Well done. Just blew your own wind out and gave away your position.~
@2162 = ~And struck fear into the enemy's hearts!~
@2163 = ~You strike the fear in, I'll strike the ribs in.~
@2164 = ~By the gods, Moidre, if you were not so skilled, I'd think you find no joy in the fight at all.~
@2165 = ~Farmers get good at shovelling crap. Think they enjoy it?~
@2166 = ~They are two different things. A man toils that he may eat, that he may be strong, that he may fight. For territory, for family, whatever he chooses; if he will not fight for it, he does not value it. And if we value nothing, we live for nothing.~
@2167 = ~Battle is not labour. 'Tis purpose.~
@2168 = ~No. It's just something that happens. Something that'll always happen.~
@2169 = ~Violence is a fact of life, war is a corpse mill and blood is red juice that stains. I won't put out my eyes to see glory where there is none.~
@2170 = ~Dwarven standards of beauty are...~
@2171 = ~Er. Interesting.~
@2172 = ~Alright. You're now in a hole. Climb or dig?~
@2173 = ~I fear even starting that sentence put a shovel in both hands.~
@2174 = ~How's a life of thieving and philandering make you think you're up to wyverns?~
@2175 = ~Moidre, my dear! You downplay my talents! Am I not a thief, a philanderer *and* the finest archer you've ever met?~
@2176 = ~Eh.~
@2177 = ~The hunt is no strange mistress to me. It so happens I've a long established trade in the heads of deadly beasts.~
@2178 = ~That why you were waiting for someone to split the job with?~
@2179 = ~Not at all. The reward was simply too great. Would you trust me to handle so much gold responsibly?~
@2180 = ~Nor, based on extensive experience, would I. ~
@2181 = ~Berserker bodyguard. Unusual choice.~
@2182 = ~'Tis a choice I stand by. Thou hast witnessed his prowess.~
@2183 = ~Sure. Good fighter. Just think he'd be better breaking lines than holding them. Must've been someone with more restraint.~
@2184 = ~Restraint?~
@2185 = ~When the gnolls found us, 'twas the first since leaving Rashemen that he truly feared for me. Feared failing me. There came no battlecry, no boastful denouncement of evil. Only howls and blood.~
@2186 = ~A beast fought for my life that day. A maddened, screaming, flailing beast. Yet even then, even as we stood side by side, never once did his blade mark me.~
@2187 = ~Perhaps there is more restraint in him than thou knowest.~
@2188 = ~You must be keen to get this over with. Get home.~
@2189 = ~'Twould shame me and the wychlaran both to rush my duties. But the wilds of Rashemen ever call, and I welcome the day I may answer again.~
@2190 = ~Mm.~
@2191 = ~Thou speak'st seldom without purpose. Surely thy inquiry was more than chatter.~
@2192 = ~Just thinking how many of us can't go home or don't want to. Nice to know some people have a happy return ahead.~
@2193 = ~Art thou one of them?~
@2194 = ~You're a smart woman. Figure it out.~
@2195 = ~You should accompany me when I return home, Moidre. You've just the kind of heedless loyalty expected of Thayvian muscle.~
@2196 = ~Maybe. Problem is, I put red on my hammer, not brown on my nose.~
@2197 = ~All share that attitude at first. All learn differently.~
@2198 = ~Good luck. Haven't learned anything my whole damn life.~
@2199 = ~Odd. I don't recall conjuring a Stinking Cloud.~
@2200 = ~Oh, it's-~
@2201 = ~Me. Yeah.~
@2202 = ~Hells and heavens, will you not even attempt an excuse? (How can I deride someone with no shame?)~
@2203 = ~I know what I smell like. If I'm used to it and you're not, whose problem is it?~
@2204 = ~Bah. I'd procure a Zone of Sweet Air scroll if I weren't convinced it would erase you entirely.~
@2205 = ~Useless dwarf! Look at these wounds I've suffered! Have you not the common sense to defend the most important man first?~
@2206 = ~If you can complain about my performance, it was good enough.~
@2207 = ~Wonderful. And I suppose you've never had greater aspirations than "good enough."~
@2208 = ~Not where you're concerned.~
@2209 = ~Let us set the beard aside for a moment. No small feat, but we'll make the effort.~
@2210 = ~Squat figure. Unflattering armour, not that there's much deserving flattery. Biceps bigger than your bosom. A stench that would turn a ghast.~
@2211 = ~Who gave you leave to call yourself a woman?~
@2212 = ~I don't. I call myself a warrior.~
@2213 = ~Are you actually alive, Moidre? Flesh and blood? A soul? It would not surprise me if we pierced that armour one day and found only enchantment spells and noxious gases.~
@2214 = ~That'd be nice.~
@2215 = ~Anything in particular bring that to mind? Or did you just need to let off some smug?~
@2216 = ~I consider it often, and for a new reason every day. Today it was your indifference to music.~
@2217 = ~My songs are always met with something. Perhaps not applause; a deficiency of the audience, naturally; but something. Frowns, jeers. A grim chuckle. That is the purpose of art. Not to evoke joy, only to evoke.~
@2218 = ~But not a peep or a twitch from you. If we weren't talking to one another, I could swear you were deaf.~
@2219 = ~Well. Could tell you your songs just aren't that good, but then you'd turn deaf as well.~
@2220 = ~So let's say...once you've lived through enough, it takes more than a few minor chords to put you in a mood.~
@2221 = ~Goodness, she says "minor" and doesn't mean a man with a pickaxe! Bursting with surprises, this one.~
@2222 = ~Stop that.~
@2223 = ~Stop scratching! Don't disturb it!~
@2224 = ~It's my damn beard.~
@2225 = ~Not anymore. I've never seen such a thriving ecosystem.~
@2226 = ~Those creatures have as much right to life as you. Mistreat them and you'll answer to me.~
@2227 = ~Druid, I'd shave to spite you. And no dwarf's ever said that lightly.~
@2228 = ~Garrick. What are you doing here?~
@2229 = ~Why should I not be here? Perhaps I'm not so deft with steel as you, but I'm sure my other skills compensate for-~
@2230 = ~Not what I meant. What's your goal? Why follow <CHARNAME>?~
@2231 = ~Oh. That's obvious, isn't it? Who better to record these grand adventures than a Berduskan-trained bard like myself?~
@2232 = ~Record what? We just fight. All we ever do. We walk places and fight people. Don't see what's exciting about that.~
@2233 = ~A good story is made in the telling, Moidre.~
@2234 = ~Only so many ways to tell it before it gets old.~
@2235 = ~You know what's pretty, Garrick?~
@2236 = ~Flowers.~
@2237 = ~Yes. They are.~
@2238 = ~Um, is there something you're trying to-~
@2239 = ~You know what's not? A beheading.~
@2240 = ~On a headsman's block, maybe. One swing, overweighted axe, head in a basket. Never in a fight. They'll catch the tail end, or the blade'll stick in their neck. Leaves it dangling by a bit of red string. Blood pissing and dribbling all over.~
@2241 = ~Sometimes the body moves afterwards. Not just a twich; big, heaving throes like a caught fish. Only the fish does it to find water again. Breathe again. A headless man just does it. Nothing still attached that knows why.~
@2242 = ~Sing that to me, Garrick. Make it pretty.~
@2243 = ~Stick to flowers.~
@2244 = ~I can't believe I've got a real guard! Always thought only toffeenoses had 'em, but now it's toffeenoses and little old Imoen. And <CHARNAME>, I guess.~
@2245 = ~Technically I'm <PRO_HISHER> guard.~
@2246 = ~Whaaatever. I'm the brains here. And the heart. And the face. <CHARNAME> is...the kidneys or something.~
@2247 = ~See? I knew you were smart. First time I saw you, I thought "There's a smart dwarf. She'll do right by us."~
@2248 = ~Here's the thing, though. My job's to keep the client alive. Had clients without brains or hearts, so those mustn't be too important.~
@2249 = ~Kidneys? Never had one without kidneys.~
@2250 = ~What about a face? You need a face to live too.~
@2251 = ~I'm doing fine, actually.~
@2252 = ~You have to protect <CHARNAME> no matter what, right?~
@2253 = ~So what if your friends or family or someone you really cared about came after <PRO_HIMHER>? What then?~
@2254 = ~No matter what means no matter what.~
@2255 = ~Wow. I...I don't know if I could do that.~
@2256 = ~Good.~
@2257 = ~Exactly how long do you plan to stay with <CHARNAME>?~
@2258 = ~I made an agreement.~
@2259 = ~Yes, and I am asking how far it goes.~
@2260 = ~Sick of me?~
@2261 = ~I would trust you more if I knew.~
@2262 = ~Mercenaries cost. <CHARNAME>'s help with the iron crisis can't have bought the rest of your life. There comes a point where I wonder at your real motives.~
@2263 = ~You made an agreement too. How long does that last?~
@2264 = ~Until <PRO_HESHE> no longer needs me.~
@2265 = ~That'll do, then.~
@2266 = ~I owe you an apology, Moidre. You've protected <CHARNAME> better than I could have asked. My distrust was uncalled for.~
@2267 = ~Nah. You want to keep someone safe, distrust is always called for. Tell you the truth, I've wondered about you once or twice. And your husband.~
@2268 = ~Khalid? He barely has the heart to hurt our enemies, let alone <CHARNAME>.~
@2269 = ~Could be an act, though. Stutter a bit, play the coward. Perfect guard-dropper.~
@2270 = ~Good grief, Moidre. There is healthy suspicion and there is utter paranoia.~
@2271 = ~Perspective. Let's say it rains. I start waving my hands and yelling shelter, because it might be poison rain from an evil mage. Paranoia?~
@2272 = ~I would say so, yes.~
@2273 = ~What if it's happened to me before?~
@2274 = ~Hey Moidre. How about it? Eh?~
@2275 = ~No chance.~
@2276 = ~Pfft.~
@2277 = ~That's it?~
@2278 = ~'S about as hard as I've ever tried.~
@2279 = ~How come you never signed up with me, Moidre? Could've built a castle of coin, the two of us.~
@2280 = ~Who are you again?~
@2281 = ~Kagain. From Beregost? The mercenary company?~
@2282 = ~Never heard of you. That's why.~
@2283 = ~That, and I like things simple. No middlemen. Payment goes from client's hand to my hand, and if it doesn't, I know who to talk to.~
@2284 = ~Decent management'd put a lot more in your hand.~
@2285 = ~Nah. Gold's like that whisper game. More you pass it on, more gets lost.~
@2286 = ~Khalid, put some meat on and maybe you'll fit in the vanguard. For now, stay behind me.~
@2287 = ~Oh, there's no need for that. N-not that I'm ungrateful, but I'm hardly a helpless merchant. You don't have to protect me.~
@2288 = ~It's my job.~
@2289 = ~B-But a unit must share its hurts, Moidre. If we let you take every wound for us, you'd die.~
@2290 = ~M-Moidre, really! You must have more regard for your health! It would be a shame to lose you.~
@2291 = ~Would it.~
@2292 = ~Of course it would! You are a valued companion and-~
@2293 = ~Who's in this party? <CHARNAME>, your wife and me.~
@2294 = ~If one of us had to die, who would you pick?~
@2295 = ~You won't say it. A good person would never say it. But we both know. Now stop complaining.~
@2296 = ~Says it all, really.~
@2297 = ~You'll wear your teeth down.~
@2298 = ~Excuse me?~
@2299 = ~You grind your teeth when you shoot. Especially bandits.~
@2300 = ~There is a certain face I put in front of every arrow I nock. It keeps me from hesitating.~
@2301 = ~Keeps you angry.~
@2302 = ~Anger's for those up front. Puts that little bit more in your swing. In the back, the archers and spellslingers, that's the place for colder blood.~
@2303 = ~Then perhaps we should trade places.~
@2304 = ~Yeah, well. You can still be fixed, I think.~
@2305 = ~Breathe, Kivan. You're alive, so don't forget it. Sometimes you fight like you're already a corpse.~
@2306 = ~As do you. First tend to the beam in your own eye.~
@2307 = ~Were you happy before you met her?~
@2308 = ~Guessing you were. You're new to brooding. I can tell. Amateurs always put too much theatre in it.~
@2309 = ~If you could bear to live without her then, you can bear it now. Don't waste what you still have.~
@2310 = ~Moidre, I appreciate your companionship, but do not presume to know my suffering.~
@2311 = ~Presume? I know your wife was murdered. What do you know about me?~
@2312 = ~Minsc has been thinking. Perhaps a sword alone is not the best way to fight. If I carried a shield as well, I could have protected my head from the gnolls, yes? And Dynaheir would not have been taken.~
@2313 = ~Think a helmet's the answer there. But they caught you off guard, right?~
@2314 = ~Yes. They came for us in the night. How foolish Minsc was to expect honour from evil!~
@2315 = ~It's not how you fight, then. It's how you watch.~
@2316 = ~Never stop watching. Right now, we're talking, you're looking at me. I'm looking ahead.~
@2317 = ~I see. But Dynaheir says we fuss too much sometimes. She has called us...what was it, Boo? "Clingy."~
@2318 = ~If people knew how best to protect themselves, they wouldn't need guards.~
@2319 = ~You say you'd give up everything to keep Dynaheir safe. Is that true?~
@2320 = ~Of course! Everything I have and more!~
@2321 = ~You answered that too quickly.~
@2322 = ~I'm sure you'd die for her. But would you give up your place in the lodge? Would you give up Boo? Give up being a hero?~
@2323 = ~That's what "everything" means, Minsc. Not just your life.~
@2324 = ~Well, it...it does not matter! Dynaheir, the witches, they are the greatest and wisest of women. To stand by them, we could be nothing but heroes!~
@2325 = ~Hope you can die believing that. Good thing humans don't live long.~
@2326 = ~Yer shield do precious little good at me back, dwarf.~
@2327 = ~Does plenty. Just not for you.~
@2328 = ~Tch. Couldn't squeeze a thimbleful o' trust from this lot. If it put ye at ease, I like to hide the turn of me coat beneath the sound of snores.~
@2329 = ~You won't be the first to try and catch me asleep. Won't be the last either.~
@2330 = ~If ever ye want for steadier work than <CHARNAME>, I've a few friends might enjoy yer company.~
@2331 = ~That's all it takes? Just knock on the door and ask?~
@2332 = ~Aye, with a member in good standing to vouch. They've many faults, these friends o' mine, but pickiness ain't among them.~
@2333 = ~StoplookingatmestoplookingatmestoplookingatmeSTOP.~
@2334 = ~Exhibit one.~
@2335 = ~You just want to be partnered with someone else.~
@2336 = ~Ye'd make a happy halfling o' me, no lie.~
@2337 = ~Your accent eludes me, Moidre. Quite the accomplishment.~
@2338 = ~That so.~
@2339 = ~No trace of that hearty shield dwarf brogue. None of the plodding gold dwarf cadence.~
@2340 = ~Wild dwarf, perhaps? Ah, but the jungle climate would punish such heavy armour. Where would you get the training? And you don't look at all like an arctic dwarf...~
@2341 = ~Been around a lot. Maybe it's just muddled.~
@2342 = ~Of course. The very thing I was about to suggest.~
@2343 = ~Do you have any hobbies at all, Moidre?~
@2344 = ~I have a job. It's this.~
@2345 = ~Well, you've done your share of travelling, at least. Are there any places you remember fondly?~
@2346 = ~Not really.~
@2347 = ~Then perhaps, and I grant you I'm reaching now, but perhaps there's a strapping dwarven gent pining for you in the caverns?~
@2348 = ~Any point to this?~
@2349 = ~I'm trying to find some common ground, dear. You're making it very difficult.~
@2350 = ~Almost like we have nothing to say to each other.~
@2351 = ~Oh, don't be so dreadfully standoffish. Can you not see the potential of you and me? Each of us has everything the other lacks. We'd make the deadliest duo in the realms if we could only communicate.~
@2352 = ~You just love the sound of your own voice.~
@2353 = ~One can hardly blame me.~
@2354 = ~What was that? Did you just splash me?~
@2355 = ~It's perfume. Arms up, please.~
@2356 = ~Did I ask for perfume?~
@2357 = ~Moidre, I understand your...~
@2358 = ~No, I don't. I will never "understand" your stance on bathing. I only acknowledge it. But something must be done, and this is the best compromise I have. Now hold still.~
@2359 = ~Fancy bottle.~
@2360 = ~Must be expensive. And you're using a lot.~
@2361 = ~Is it really worth it?~
@2362 = ~I might just have to duel you one of these days, Moidre.~
@2363 = ~You'd lose.~
@2364 = ~Hah! Now I definitely have to.~
@2365 = ~You burn too hot. Never a fighting moment you aren't screaming and swinging.~
@2366 = ~I kill fast and I kill hard.~
@2367 = ~Yeah. You cut a man into stewing chunks and then you have to catch your breath. Every fight leaves you bent double.~
@2368 = ~When the hate's all spent and someone's still standing, what happens?~
@2369 = ~No man can exhaust my hate.~
@2370 = ~Except I'm a woman.~
@2371 = ~By the hells, Moidre, will you cut that foul thing off?~
@2372 = ~Specifically?~
@2373 = ~The beard! Or the clump hanging from your chin, at least. More filth than hair. As if a bearded woman wasn't disgusting enough...~
@2374 = ~I'm a dwarf, you're not. Accept the difference.~
@2375 = ~Give it here. A pull and a slice will-~
@2376 = ~DON'T YOU DARE.~
@2377 = ~Don't. You. Dare.~
@2378 = ~Ha ha! That's the first time I've ever seen you angry!~
@2379 = ~Pray it's the last.~
@2380 = ~I left my father's estate to get away from this.~
@2381 = ~This! People looming over me all the time, trying to "protect" me. Give me some space, will you?~
@2382 = ~Ever get attacked by bandits in your estate?~
@2383 = ~No, but-~
@2384 = ~Wolves?~
@2385 = ~UGGGHHH. Listen, just because something hasn't happened to me before doesn't mean I can't handle it. Alright? I can make my own choices, I can solve my own problems, and I'm SICK and TIRED of being treated like I'm just some pretty ornament!~
@2386 = ~Eldoth, make her go away.~
@2387 = ~Shut up, dearest.~
@2388 = ~When Eldoth joined us, he told us about this plan he had. Know what it was?~
@2389 = ~The plan to get me out of the estate, right? Thank you so much for helping him.~
@2390 = ~That was half of it. The other half was ransoming you to your father.~
@2391 = ~It's true. He's skimming your family fortune as we speak. Ask <CHARNAME>.~
@2392 = ~You're lying. That's...that's ridiculous. He'd never do that.~
@2393 = ~Have we ever met before?~
@2394 = ~No?~
@2395 = ~Ask yourself why I'd make that up, then.~
@2396 = ~I bet you just don't like Eldoth, do you?~
@2397 = ~He's...short with people sometimes, I know. He has a lot on his mind. He probably offended your dwarven pride or something like that, didn't he? So now you want to get him in trouble with me. That's why you lied.~
@2398 = ~Why're you telling me? It's yourself you need to convince.~
@2399 = ~Eldoth loves me.~
@2400 = ~Same for that.~
@2401 = ~Royal guard.~
@2402 = ~Huh?~
@2403 = ~You. Dwarf. You are now part of Tiax's royal guard. Rejoice that you may bask day and night in his glory.~
@2404 = ~Wouldn't have thought someone of your stature'd need a lowly dwarf to guard him.~
@2405 = ~Tiax does not *need* you. 'Tis a matter of custom. Where a king walks, his procession of loyal followers clear the way.~
@2406 = ~Well, why not. Cyric's Chosen. Wouldn't be the worst I've fought for.~
@2407 = ~When someone goes on about strength as much as you do, I shouldn't be able to see their ribs.~
@2408 = ~I am wearing armour.~
@2409 = ~Yeah. It's that bad.~
@2410 = ~My, a clever hargluk. What a rare find this is. I should have you mounted.~
@2411 = ~Since you're so clever, you'll understand that muscle is but one shape of power.~
@2412 = ~Still. I have it, you don't. So in one sense, I have you beat. Gonna stand for that?~
@2413 = ~Is this just some desperate attempt to deny your inferiority, or do you have a point to make?~
@2414 = ~Eat more.~
@2415 = ~Bah. I'd sooner wither than gorge myself on surface slop as you do.~
@2416 = ~Fair enough. Let me know if the wind picks up. I'll stand in front.~
@2417 = ~Yeah, as if she's shoved half as much meat down her throat as you, Viconia.~
@2418 = ~"Silence, jaluk!"~
@2419 = ~Silence, j...~
@2420 = ~As always, like a book.~
@2421 = ~All the crap you must've gone through to become a priestess, and yet second helpings are too much for you.~
@2422 = ~This again? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. It'll take you at least another day to have a new thought.~
@2423 = ~Trying to help. Know you're not used to it, but that's what's happening.~
@2424 = ~Oh, how sweet, the little hargluk just wants to help. Would that we had more of you back home. We'd save so much time.~
@2425 = ~You and me, strength is all we have. Maybe sometimes we pretend it's all that matters, but if that was true, we wouldn't be where we are.~
@2426 = ~If it's all I have, it's all I can give. I can't take you home again or bring back what you lost. I can only make you stronger. So put your pride in that stew and swallow it.~
@2427 = ~Do not ever presume of me! Speak again of what I've lost and I'll have your tongue!~
@2428 = ~Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe not. You're the one who knows.~
@2429 = ~Buck up, Xan. It's not as bad as you think.~
@2430 = ~Moidre, of all people in this group, you are the one I would trust not to ply me with encouraging platitudes. Let me keep what few comforts I have.~
@2431 = ~Can't have you folding up mid-fight. Someone'll die.~
@2432 = ~You're worn down. I know that feeling. Only thing I've felt for a long time. But sometimes, seems like you don't even want to bother trying. One day you might not.~
@2433 = ~Soon though that day may be coming, I don't expect we'll live even that long. We're doomed. All of us.~
@2434 = ~We are. So push it back. We do it every battle, you with your spells, me with my shield.~
@2435 = ~No matter how tired you get. Even if you're long past seeing the point. You put up what you have and push it back.~
@2436 = ~And when we can push it no further?~
@2437 = ~Then you're ready for it.~
@2438 = ~Nice to have a mage that isn't all fire and lightning and no aim.~
@2439 = ~Bah! As if a dwarf could have the first inkling-~
@2440 = ~Wasn't talking to you.~
@2441 = ~You spend too much time among humans. With such short lives, they haven't the patience to learn restraint.~
@2442 = ~You mean we haven't the luxury of complacency. Has it not dawned on you that for all your centuries of navel-gazing, you are no more powerful than I?~
@2443 = ~Easier to work with, though.~
@2444 = ~So it's an elf thing. Don't suppose there's room in Evereska for a wandering dwarven merc?~
@2445 = ~Without wishing to insult you...~
@2446 = ~No. Never.~
@2447 = ~No insult. Heard it too many times now to take it personally.~
@2448 = ~Chick-chick-chick-chick-chickeeen! Spare a little shield for me.~
@2449 = ~I'm guessing that's me.~
@2450 = ~Do you see any other chickens?~
@2451 = ~Not that it would matter. The important question is, do I see any?~
@2452 = ~There'd be plenty of shield if you'd stay in formation.~
@2453 = ~HOW CAN I STAY IN FORMATION~
@2454 = ~WITH ALL~
@2455 = ~THESE CHICKENS~
@2456 = ~AROUND?~
@2457 = ~This is why I need the shield. Do you not understand? The pecking is interminable.~
@2458 = ~Can we get him a tether? And a gag?~
@2459 = ~Don't bother. Fecker gnaws right through 'em.~
@2460 = ~Ahh!~
@2461 = ~What? Where are they?~
@2462 = ~I've just realised! I've never worked with the short folk before!~
@2463 = ~Montaron's right there.~
@2464 = ~No no. I've never "worked with" the short folk. In an academic capacity.~
@2465 = ~And with so much to learn! Whatever could I have missed? Would the natural magic resistance still be a factor after-~
@2466 = ~Listen here. My job is to protect people, and the terms are "until death." Not a second after.~
@2467 = ~My corpse starts walking, the first thing it'll do is crack your loathsome little head open and let the sickness bleed out.~
@2468 = ~Trepanning. Monty dearest has tried it so many times, bless him.~
@2469 = ~I'll ask yer pardon. All that business in the Cloakwood and I've done neglected proper introductions to me kin. Yeslick Orothiar.~
@2470 = ~Moidre...?~
@2471 = ~Hmm. Says much of a dwarf when they'll give their own name and nay their clan's.~
@2472 = ~Could be I got exiled.~
@2473 = ~Or I don't have one. Or don't remember it. Or maybe I'm just an honourless dog.~
@2474 = ~Which be it?~
@2475 = ~Says much of a dwarf when he'll ask that question instead of answering it himself.~
@2476 = ~Ye recall I told ye of how me mine was flooded?~
@2477 = ~I do.~
@2478 = ~The fault lay with me, if it laid at all. 'Twas not for anyone to know, but ne'ertheless. The people looked for guidance, and I guided them to water, and that be the truth. Me own fool pick drowned me clanhome and me own fool tongue gave them Iron Throne the run of it. ~
@2479 = ~I've nay seen another Orothiar since. But I've nay set it aside neither. 'Tis Yeslick Orothiar I say, and Yeslick Orothiar me grave will say.~
@2480 = ~So I dinnae care what you done, or they done, or anyone done. Clan's clan.~
@2481 = ~Well what? You're right.~
@2482 = ~You got it backwards, you know.~
@2483 = ~I gave you my clan name. Moidre. It's my own name I didn't say.~
@2484 = ~Ah. Now that says much of a dwarf too. Altogether different things.~
@2485 = ~Clan Moidre. Nary a bell rung. Will ye enlighten me?~
@2486 = ~No. It'd make you sad. Don't want that.~
@2487 = ~So. Now that the cat has finally torn its starving, emaciated body free of the bag...~
@2488 = ~Ever take any jobs in the Underdark, Moidre?~
@2489 = ~No. I told you, I'm only half-duergar. Raised by dwarves, in a dwarven cavern, never set one foot in the Underdark. Understand?~
@2490 = ~Would you like to?~
@2491 = ~Because I couldn't help overhearing about those slaves you want to rescue. Seems to me like someone who's never set one foot in the Underdark should be looking for a guide first, before they go stumbling into a very painful and very pointless death.~
@2492 = ~Luckily for you, I've got some work to do down there myself. You scratch my back...~
@2493 = ~You want my help starting a revolution.~
@2494 = ~No no. That's for me to worry about. You needn't trouble your pretty little helmet.~
@2495 = ~All I want is for you to do what you do what you do best. Follow me around, smell like a sewer, and be the bludgeon to my scalpel. And since I know it matters to you, I can guarantee that down in the Dark, every prospective bludgeonee will have it coming.~
@2496 = ~If I agree to this, I want them all found. Not just one or two. Dead or alive, that can't be helped anymore, but a full account. One way or the other.~
@2497 = ~Fair enough, but it sounds like a lot of faces. Do you even remember them all?~
@2498 = ~Yes. Every one.~
@2499 = ~Drow! You-~
@2500 = ~Human!~
@2501 = ~You stand in the sight of-~
@2502 = ~Human.~
@2503 = ~You, ah-~
@2504 = ~Human. Huuuuuman. Human.~
@2505 = ~Vynd?~
@2506 = ~Another time. The moment's passed.~
@2507 = ~Shame.~
@2508 = ~Vynd! You stand in the sight of Helm the Vigilant. Through me, his judgment shall be passed. Will you renounce the cruelty of your people?~
@2509 = ~What the hell are you doing.~
@2510 = ~I am sworn to destroy evil in Helm's name, but my hand is stayed for those who repent. Even drow are not beyond salvation.~
@2511 = ~I ask again. Will you renounce your people and embrace the ways of the surface?~
@2512 = ~So in effect, and I know this isn't the core issue in your mind, but *in effect*, I'm deciding whether you try to kill me or not.~
@2513 = ~Well...yes.~
@2514 = ~I'll get back to you on that.~
@2515 = ~Vynd, I cannot let you delay this any longer. If you will not recant the Spider Queen and her doctrines, I have no choice but to strike you down.~
@2516 = ~I don't worship Lolth, moron.~
@2517 = ~Does that count as recanting?~
@2518 = ~Then to which god do you-~
@2519 = ~Eldath.~
@2520 = ~...Eldath.~
@2521 = ~Yep. Springs and waterfalls. I pledge my faith here and now, and may she strike me dead if I deceive.~
@2522 = ~See? Nothing.~
@2523 = ~Mind you, Eldath is a pacifistic goddess. She would not harm Vynd even if he were lying.~
@2524 = ~THANKS, Jaheira.~
@2525 = ~What the-~
@2526 = ~Got your purse!~
@2527 = ~Oh. So you did. What a delightful little scamp you are. Give it back.~
@2528 = ~You want it? Come on, then! Betcha can't catch mee-eee!~
@2529 = ~Betcha can't defend yourself in your slee-eeep!~
@2530 = ~You heard me.~
@2531 = ~What's it gonna take to make that cloudy face beam, Vynd?~
@2532 = ~Kill yourself.~
@2533 = ~Hey now! There's no need to be mean!~
@2534 = ~You asked.~
@2535 = ~Tempus would be more popular if he'd let people fight smart.~
@2536 = ~Smart? Ah, the craven's word for "dirty." Cowering in the shadows, letting poison and fatigue do the work. Your own gods uphold those virtues well enough.~
@2537 = ~Mm. Maybe you're right. No point winning if it isn't clean.~
@2538 = ~Speaking of which, you should really lose the armour.~
@2539 = ~Well, come on. Hiding inside a safe coat of metal? How is that fair to all those poor bandits in nothing but leather?~
@2540 = ~That hammer needs to go too. If you have to rely on a *weapon*, some chunk of iron that you bought in a *shop*, then geez. Might as well be a florist.~
@2541 = ~Oh, and all those spells, you know, the magic you borrow to make you stronger...~
@2542 = ~I could crumple your skull like an eggshell, boy.~
@2543 = ~...that doesn't invalidate my point.~
@2544 = ~It does where Tempus is concerned.~
@2545 = ~Have you *no* stomach for a brawl, Vynd? Stories say the drow come of age in the fighting pits.~
@2546 = ~I'm a child at heart. And which stories are these, exactly? Published stories? Seasoned travellers who toured the Underdark, or some bloke in a pub?~
@2547 = ~'Cause you can learn a lot about the drow from blokes in pubs. Did you know we eat our young? Every firstborn male? Don't remember that happening to me, but the guy seemed so sure of himself.~
@2548 = ~Point taken.~
@2549 = ~Fresh out of the womb, too. "Kid on the cord," we call it.~
@2550 = ~Point taken!~
@2551 = ~Coran. I was wondering how many notches you've got on the old belt. If you know what I mean.~
@2552 = ~Couldn't tell you, friend. I ran out of space for notches a few years back.~
@2553 = ~I believe that. Which one would you say was the worst?~
@2554 = ~Worst? Ah, there have been some fumbles here and there, but 'tis hardly a gentleman's place to criticise. We were all innocent once, no?~
@2555 = ~Wait, wait. I'm not sure we're on the same page. I was talking about genital diseases.~
@2556 = ~I'll still accept "I lost count," though.~
@2557 = ~Before we play, I should warn you. I'm known among surfacers as a dart elf.~
@2558 = ~I don't suppose you've a gambler's heart beneath the frost?~
@2559 = ~Not really. "Gamble" implies a chance of losing.~
@2560 = ~What'll it be, then? Would you rather fill my purse or my cup?~
@2561 = ~Whichever. I'm easy.~
@2562 = ~Not *that* kind of easy. Settle down.~
@2563 = ~I wasn't-~
@2564 = ~Gods, it's like someone stepped on a rake.~
@2565 = ~So. You and the big fella...?~
@2566 = ~No? No what? What was I gonna say?~
@2567 = ~Thou wilt not bait me. We both know thy question, and no is the answer.~
@2568 = ~'Cause I heard about this trick you can do with small rodents, and I'm wondering if he ever-~
@2569 = ~Do not speak such filth to me!~
@2570 = ~Oh, you know about it? Very thorough education you witches get.~
@2571 = ~Minsc is confused. You wish to see Boo do a trick?~
@2572 = ~If I know my cultures, women spellcasters run the show in Rashemen. "The Wychlaran can do no wrong."~
@2573 = ~Thou knowest much of foreign lands.~
@2574 = ~I like to read about them. Find out what I've been missing. But here's the interesting part; no boys allowed. Any man gets caught with a spellbook, he has to choose between exile or execution. That about right?~
@2575 = ~'Tis so, yes.~
@2576 = ~Any logical reason for that? Because I'm reminded of a certain other race.~
@2577 = ~Where doth this lead, Vynd? Am I to be blamed for my nation's customs?~
@2578 = ~Do you follow them?~
@2579 = ~'Tis not my place to decide-~
@2580 = ~Yes, then.~
@2581 = ~Vynd, let us say thou wert not a man.~
@2582 = ~...unusual opener.~
@2583 = ~Hast thou considered what thy path in life may have been?~
@2584 = ~Only every single time I had to stare at the floor when a lady walked into the room.~
@2585 = ~Not thy circumstances. Thy path. Thy outlook.~
@2586 = ~If thou wert born a woman into thy traditions, wouldst thou fight them still, or embrace all they offered?~
@2587 = ~How the hell should I know? Didn't happen, doesn't matter.~
@2588 = ~If thou wouldst seek change from those in power, ask first what thou wouldst change had power been thine. Injustice is more easily seen by victims than beneficiaries.~
@2589 = ~Yes, I'm sure they just didn't realise the damage they were causing when they beat me bloody. Get bent, hathran.~
@2590 = ~Edwin. I need a favour.~
@2591 = ~And? Shall I point you to someone who'll oblige?~
@2592 = ~A *paid* favour.~
@2593 = ~...go on.~
@2594 = ~Listen, people love to fling dirt at the Red Wizards, but anyone with any sense knows they're the best damn mages in Faerun. And I'm a sensible man.~
@2595 = ~So I need a little magic, and I need it from you. You're the only one I can trust to do this right.~
@2596 = ~Yes yes, I understand. What do you want?~
@2597 = ~I found this sword here, and I have a feeling it's magical. Can you identify it?~
@2598 = ~Of course you can. Obviously. That's preschool stuff. First thing any wizard learns how to do. The simplest divination spell, one you could probably train a monkey to cast. There's no way that's beyond you.~
@2599 = ~Right?~
@2600 = ~So who'd you cross?~
@2601 = ~(I swear I've met snakes with stiller tongues.) What are you prattling about now?~
@2602 = ~To get kicked out of Thay. Who'd you piss off? Can't have been anyone that powerful, or they'd have just killed you.~
@2603 = ~I was not kicked out! I am here on important business. *Crucial* business.~
@2604 = ~Killing Dynaheir, yeah. Good hustle, by the way.~
@2605 = ~Quite.~
@2606 = ~Let's be honest, though. They shipped you to the other side of the continent with no retinue, no support, I'm guessing the briefing was vague, and you barely even had any money. That, Edwin, is a just long way of saying "kicked out."~
@2607 = ~Fine talk from a vagrant drow. Even if what you say is true, how are you any different?~
@2608 = ~Would you rather be in Thay right now?~
@2609 = ~Obviously!~
@2610 = ~There you go, then.~
@2611 = ~You know what's funny, Edwin?~
@2612 = ~Shut up.~
@2613 = ~You were trying to kill Dynaheir, and you hired us to help you out.~
@2614 = ~But if you'd just sat back and waited, she'd eventually have been eaten by all the gnolls we slaughtered to get to her.~
@2615 = ~So all that time and effort, all that distance you travelled, and you accomplished absolutely nothing.~
@2616 = ~So not only did you not kill her, you pretty much rescued her.~
@2617 = ~Indeed. Thou hast my gratitude.~
@2618 = ~Shut. Up.~
@2619 = ~Call us incompetent again, Edwin. For old times' sake.~
@2620 = ~Hi! Eldoth! Nobody likes you.~
@2621 = ~I beg your pardon?~
@2622 = ~I'm just making it clear, since you don't seem to have noticed. Nobody in this party likes, needs or wants you. Not a single person. You are a toad piloting a man who can't fight.~
@2623 = ~If you abandoned us right now, just walked away with all your equipment, no-one would make the slightest effort to stop you. And if you don't believe me, leave. Leave and see if anyone calls you back. Go on. I know how much you like to win. Prove me wrong. Do it.~
@2624 = ~Exactly.~
@2625 = ~Eldoth, I was thinking...~
@2626 = ~Not now, beloved.~
@2627 = ~But I just wanted to say-~
@2628 = ~Skie, you've had too many opinions of late, and my poor head is a-throb from hearing them. Or perhaps there lies the intent? Do you mean to drive me away?~
@2629 = ~No...no. I'm sorry. I'll just...~
@2630 = ~As I have said many times, my darling, a woman should know her-~
@2631 = ~Skie! Did you still want to put that braid in?~
@2632 = ~Oh, yes! That is, uh, if Eldoth doesn't mind...~
@2633 = ~I do. Skie and I are discussing an important matter, so if you'd kindly-~
@2634 = ~Hmm, yes, don't mind me, I'm just a pitiless killer who doesn't need to sleep.~
@2635 = ~...if you'd kindly be quick about it, dear.~
@2636 = ~Thank you, sweetiepie!~
@2637 = ~Oh no. Look what you did.~
@2638 = ~What? What is it?~
@2639 = ~You stepped on the grass! Look, it's all crushed!~
@2640 = ~I don't-~
@2641 = ~Ahh! You did it again!~
@2642 = ~Some things are unavoidable. No creature of land can-~
@2643 = ~Faldorn, stop! Stop it! This is a massacre! You're supposed to be a druid!~
@2644 = ~So I disagree with your philosophy. I don't know if that came across last time.~
@2645 = ~Look at this. You want humans to move out of places like these, where they are safe and warm, and into the dirt and the rain. With wild animals.~
@2646 = ~Those who respect the natural order have nothing to fear from it.~
@2647 = ~This *is* the natural order. Birds build nests, bees build hives, people build cities.~
@2648 = ~The birds and bees do not tear up the earth and flatten the forest.~
@2649 = ~Then you obviously aren't doing it right.~
@2650 = ~YES! Dicey setup, but it paid off. Choke on it, druid.~
@2651 = ~Where'd you get your club, Faldorn?~
@2652 = ~From a dead tree that was blown to the ground in a naturally occurring storm.~
@2653 = ~...damn. You were ready for that one, huh?~
@2654 = ~Everyone asks sooner or later.~
@2655 = ~Garrick. Play that song for me.~
@2656 = ~Certainly! Er, which one?~
@2657 = ~You know, that fruity little ballad. The one I cringe every time I hear. The one that makes me want to tear Milil down from the heavens and stomp out his teeth for giving us the gift of music.~
@2658 = ~Just play any song, Garrick. It'll be the right one.~
@2659 = ~Look at that, Vynd. My audience applauds while you hide in the corner and sneer.~
@2660 = ~Uh. What?~
@2661 = ~Don't you remember? You were giving me your *esteemed* opinion of my "fruity little ballads." What do you think of them now?~
@2662 = ~That was ages ago. Are you kidding me? All that time to cook up a comeback? If you spent that long working on your songs, maybe one of them would be listenable.~
@2663 = ~Scoff all you like, but these people can appreciate good music. I'm not to blame if you can't.~
@2664 = ~I do appreciate it. I'll have you know I played bards back home.~
@2665 = ~...you mean you played *with* bards? A troupe?~
@2666 = ~No, I played bards. As instruments. You know how you play a violin with a bow? You play a bard with a knife.~
@2667 = ~How about it? Wanna sing one of my tunes? I guarantee we'll get more applause.~
@2668 = ~Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! You're too good to me! Especially you, milady.~
@2669 = ~This next piece I wrote for my instructor in Berdusk...~
@2670 = ~Hey Minsc. What's your hamster's name again?~
@2671 = ~Boo.~
@2672 = ~Pardon? Didn't catch that.~
@2673 = ~*Boo.*~
@2674 = ~Sorry, it's all the noise in here. A little louder?~
@2675 = ~Boo!~
@2676 = ~Again?~
@2677 = ~BOO! BOOOOOO!~
@2678 = ~Got it. Thanks.~
@2679 = ~You wear a lot of pink.~
@2680 = ~Yup. Favourite colour.~
@2681 = ~Is Candlekeep pink?~
@2682 = ~Uh...no, but only for want of me and paint. Why?~
@2683 = ~I just noticed you sneak around a lot. Blending in, you might say. That seems to be your role in this group.~
@2684 = ~You wear bright pink.~
@2685 = ~Never gave me a lick of hassle. 'Course, some amateurs gotta dress all dark and dismal. Cripple's crutch, if y'ask me.~
@2686 = ~Oh ho ho!~
@2687 = ~You have just started something you'll regret.~
@2688 = ~Talkin' to you?~
@2689 = ~Don't pile it on, kid. Know when to stop.~
@2690 = ~Vynd! I got ya a present.~
@2691 = ~You stole me a present.~
@2692 = ~Close enough. Open it.~
@2693 = ~Did I mention you'd regret starting this? I think I did.~
@2694 = ~Still waitin' for it.~
@2695 = ~I'm an elf. I can take my time.~
@2696 = ~Zzz...~
@2697 = ~ZzzZZzz...~
@2698 = ~YOU HAVE BEEN WAYLAID BY ENEMIES AND MUST DEFEND YOURSELF.~ [ERROR10]
@2699 = ~Wha-?!~
@2700 = ~I hear the word "Harpers" a lot lately. Does that mean anything to you?~
@2701 = ~Music? Personally, I favour the lyre.~
@2702 = ~Yeah. Here's a tip. If you want to be evasive, don't put the word "liar" in people's heads.~
@2703 = ~Come on, nobody would believe me anyway. What's it like? Is the pay good? Might be a new career path for me.~
@2704 = ~If there were such an organisation, I doubt they would accept you. I'm told they have certain principles. Morals, even.~
@2705 = ~Jaheira, lay down enough gold and I'll be a paladin.~
@2706 = ~Vynd, if I catch you ogling me again, I'll be the last thing you see. Consider yourself warned.~
@2707 = ~Not ogling, don't worry. You're at least three varieties of "not my type."~
@2708 = ~Then what are you staring at?~
@2709 = ~I'm just trying to find that whip you so expertly conceal on your person.~
@2710 = ~D-Don't speak to her that way!~
@2711 = ~Trained him to like it too, did you? Damn, you're good.~
@2712 = ~Leave it, Khalid. A drow wouldn't understand.~
@2713 = ~Jaheira, Khalid, listen. I'll put my hand up and say I've got a lot of acid in me. Sometimes I talk seriously, sometimes I'm just discharging the build-up, and people can't always tell. So let me preface this; I'm about be sincere.~
@2714 = ~You two could paint your skin black, walk into any drow city, and nobody would suspect.~
@2715 = ~And does that reflect more on us or you?~
@2716 = ~Equal measure, I'd say.~
@2717 = ~(Fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven...)~
@2718 = ~Forty-one, sixty-eight, thirty-three.~
@2719 = ~Fort...er, fift...damn you!~
@2720 = ~Oh no! Now you have to re-count your money!~
@2721 = ~Again.~
@2722 = ~...Kagain.~
@2723 = ~Kagain. When we get back to your shop, could I take out a loan?~
@2724 = ~Eh? No. Moneylendin' ain't my business. And moneylendin' to drow definitely ain't.~
@2725 = ~No? I could've sworn. I dunno, you just have "Pay up or I break your legs" written all over you.~
@2726 = ~Never too late to branch out, though. Think about it. You're already at optimum kneecapping height.~
@2727 = ~That's right.~
@2728 = ~I am.~
@2729 = ~...I'll just end that discussion there.~
@2730 = ~Er, V-Vynd, you, er, y-y...~
@2731 = ~Stop.~
@2732 = ~Whatever it is, write it down. I haven't got an hour to spare right now.~
@2733 = ~H-Here.~
@2734 = ~What's this?~
@2735 = ~Er, r-remember, you said I should...~
@2736 = ~Oh gods, you actually wrote it down? Take your muzzle off, kid.~
@2737 = ~Alright, if it's that important...~
@2738 = ~"Dear Vynd. You have something stuck in your teeth. Khalid."~
@2739 = ~So I did.~
@2740 = ~Well spotted.~
@2741 = ~Y-You're welcome.~
@2742 = ~If she told you to jump off a cliff, would you-~
@2743 = ~She wouldn't. But yes.~
@2744 = ~Tell us more about your dead girlfriend, Kivan.~
@2745 = ~Wife. She was my wife.~
@2746 = ~Ah. Sorry, I forgot. It's been so long since you brought it up.~
@2747 = ~I'll carve it into the arrow I've saved for you. That will help you remember.~
@2748 = ~Oh, am I not allowed to talk about her? No problem. I'm sure you can pick up my slack.~
@2749 = ~I've had a couple of run-ins with Shevarashans before. Shevarashians? Shevarashoes?~
@2750 = ~Arseheads. I've had some run-ins with them. From what I understand, he's the god of genocide against drow. Not sure anyone needed a deity specifically for that, but whatever. I'm biased.~
@2751 = ~So you and your squeeze go for a jaunt in the woods, and some bandits show up to spoil the picnic. Human bandits.~
@2752 = ~And somehow that's our fault.~
@2753 = ~<CHARNAME>. Rid yourself of this creature before I do it for you.~
@2754 = ~You sure you want to keep him around? The man's strung higher than his bow.~
@2755 = ~You know that drow saying, "All love is foolish"? I don't usually care for our proverbs, but I think there's some truth in that one.~
@2756 = ~Sure, you'll never experience the tender, beautiful fulfilment that only a soulmate can give. That surge of warmth when they touch you. The blissful oblivion in the depths of their eyes.~
@2757 = ~On the other hand, you'll never wake up to find your will to live humped to death by an ogre.~
@2758 = ~Those were your last words, drow!~
@2759 = ~Kivan, stop! This is what he wants!~
@2760 = ~That's enough, both of you!~
@2761 = ~Settle down, Kivan!~
@2762 = ~Stop baiting him, Vynd!~
@2763 = ~I won't let you harbour him anymore! If I must fight you as well, I will!~
@2764 = ~Sorry, Vynd. You heard the man.~
@2765 = ~So be it, Kivan. Defend yourself.~
@2766 = ~I was with you until you threatened me. Give my regards to your wife, Kivan.~
@2767 = ~Anyone who'd start a fight over bait is a liability. I'm telling you, we'd be better off without him.~
@2768 = ~See?~
@2769 = ~Huh. Forgive me if I don't stick around, then.~
@2770 = ~Shevarash guide my aim!~
@2771 = ~Then he shall have it! Would you have me do nothing while a venomous spider crawls on my skin?!~
@2772 = ~I would have you stay your hand for one who hasn't wronged us.~
@2773 = ~Vynd, this is getting out of hand. I can't keep talking him down for you.~
@2774 = ~He has wronged me, and he has wronged my Deheriana. I will not watch him spit on her memory.~
@2775 = ~It won't happen again. Will it, Vynd?~
@2776 = ~Do you honestly think that'll change anything? He wants me dead, <CHARNAME>. Sooner or later he'll stop looking for excuses.~
@2777 = ~I swear that if Kivan turns his bow on you, I'll do everything in my power to stop him. But *only* if you don't stir the pot.~
@2778 = ~You could sell my head for the bounty any time you wanted, but I don't goad you into trying it.~
@2779 = ~Oh, is the poor drow nervous? I don't give a damn. I paid for a professional, not some jittery little boy. Which did I get?~
@2780 = ~Forget it. You're on your own, Vynd.~
@2781 = ~Gods, diplomacy is boring. Let's just kill Kivan and be done with it.~
@2782 = ~Fine. No more poking the wound.~
@2783 = ~And I want you to apologise.~
@2784 = ~Kivan? Can we call a truce?~
@2785 = ~Don't bother. It won't be sincere.~
@2786 = ~He's right. Let's just leave it at that.~
@2787 = ~A truce. Nothing more. He'll betray us one day, as sure as the sun sets. But I will wait for it.~
@2788 = ~You know, I tried. I really, really tried hard to think of something to talk about besides the hamster.~
@2789 = ~'Cause I bet everyone just asks about the damn hamster. I can't imagine someone being curious about your hobbies, or your aspirations in life. It's always gonna be the hamster. And you must be tired of it.~
@2790 = ~But I couldn't do it. I lost, Minsc. I surrender. I got NOTHING.~
@2791 = ~Tell me everything there is to know about that furry little bastard. Right now.~
@2792 = ~Vynd, that is the greatest sentence Minsc has ever heard spoken.~
@2793 = ~What exactly happens when you finish this journey?~
@2794 = ~And we return to Rashemen? Then Minsc shall be honoured as a full-fledged berserker, and evil everywhere will shake the earth with its trembling!~
@2795 = ~Right right, but where do you go from there? They don't shackle you to a witch for the rest of your life, do they?~
@2796 = ~Ooh, do you think they would? I have not thought much of life after dajemma.~
@2797 = ~I hope it is as you say, my friend. Minsc and Boo are great indeed, but Minsc and Boo and Dynaheir are greater still.~
@2798 = ~...yeah. I'd say you could do a lot better, big guy. But as long as it's what you want.~
@2799 = ~Montaron, Montaron, his lips at crotch height are,~
@2800 = ~And that is most fortuitous, for his buddy Xzar.~
@2801 = ~You like that? Had to mangle the sentence a bit. Not much to rhyme with Xzar.~
@2802 = ~Any more poetry an' I'll mangle more than yer sentences, elf.~
@2803 = ~With your teeth?~
@2804 = ~Yeah, that probably went over your head. Sorry.~
@2805 = ~Hah, over your head! I wasn't even trying there.~
@2806 = ~Montaron, I bought you a razor, and you're going to use it on your repugnant feet. This is not up for debate.~
@2807 = ~Buy a wood rasp too, and I'll do ye a deal. I'll shave the hairs off me feet after ye file the points off yer ears.~
@2808 = ~There is a key distinction there, which I will explain to you. I flash a pointy ear, and people swoon. They want to touch them. Nibble them. And therein lies the difference.~
@2809 = ~Never, in the history of time, has someone wanted those nauseating pube rugs in their mouth.~
@2810 = ~Shows what ye know of halfling girlies, eejit.~
@2811 = ~How is it I've never met one single gnome that didn't get on my nerves? You'd expect a few exceptions, but no. Every time, without fail.~
@2812 = ~Because you're an ill-educated savage who fears intellectualism?~
@2813 = ~I'm not convinced you aren't all pulling a giant prank on everyone else. I bet you're normal behind closed doors. I bet you go home and brag to your friends about all the tall folk you've been riling up lately.~
@2814 = ~Hah! Joke's on you. I don't have any f...I mean, I don't, er, play pranks. That's a stereotype, perpetuated by the ignorant.~
@2815 = ~Of course, that'd mean you're doing it on purpose. I'm not sure if that's better or worse.~
@2816 = ~Did you hear me? I said I don't-~
@2817 = ~You know how the drow have been oppressing the deep gnomes for centuries? All I'm saying, Quayle, is that I'm not sure we're the villains there.~
@2818 = ~You're not even listening, are you? You're just rambling.~
@2819 = ~OH, DOES THAT IRRITATE YOU? I'M SO SORRY.~
@2820 = ~Could you spare me a moment, Vynd?~
@2821 = ~Oh. My turn, is it?~
@2822 = ~Well, you've tried to slither down everyone else's breeches. I knew you'd get to me sooner or later.~
@2823 = ~Kept you waiting, did I? Forgive me. I do love to let the anticipation build.~
@2824 = ~Dread. You love to let the dread build.~
@2825 = ~Come now, must you use that tongue of yours to wound me? I'm sure it's capable of more than that...~
@2826 = ~I'm not into women. And I'm not into hobgoblins either, so you're double shafted.~
@2827 = ~Not that that's a new experience for you.~
@2828 = ~I'm surprised, Vynd. Scorn from you, of all people? Surely the drow aren't too prudish to profit from their charms.~
@2829 = ~Profit from whatever you want. I don't care. When you expect me to fall for it, though...~
@2830 = ~Ah, perhaps I should have known better. Audacity is my boon and burden.~
@2831 = ~Still, perhaps a more gentle rebuff next time? A lady's feelings are delicate.~
@2832 = ~I told you I'm not into women, didn't I? Yes. I did. You're not either, I take it.~
@2833 = ~Imagine you're known for your supple body. Imagine when people introduce you, they say "This is Safana, she's very dextrous, wink wink."~
@2834 = ~Imagine?~
@2835 = ~Now imagine growing up expected to cater to every smirking termagant who looks your way.~
@2836 = ~Now imagine you just escaped that life, and then up comes some touchy-feely surface girl with a headful of presumption.~
@2837 = ~Ah...well...~
@2838 = ~Now name every god you can and thank them I'm reasonable. Because if I wasn't, you'd be nursing more than your ego.~
@2839 = ~Get away from me, pig.~
@2840 = ~Okay.~
@2841 = ~And take your eyes off me as well.~
@2842 = ~No problem.~
@2843 = ~Don't even speak to me.~
@2844 = ~Huh. I'll take "pig" back, because even pigs have spines. Should I order you to crawl next?~
@2845 = ~Well, you obviously have some issues, troubled past, weren't treated great, and I'm not looking to aggravate it. Kinda sympathise, honestly. My upbringing wasn't the best either. Underdark. You know.~
@2846 = ~Incidentally.~
@2847 = ~Not counting your right hand.~
@2848 = ~When's the last time you got off?~
@2849 = ~Bastard!~
@2850 = ~Woop!~
@2851 = ~Ugh. Only bad part of stabbing a man is having to wipe his stink off the blade.~
@2852 = ~I'm actually curious now. Where do all these misandric tantrums stem from? I'm guessing you weren't daddy's favourite kid, since he called you "Shart."~
@2853 = ~Shar-Teel!~
@2854 = ~Shart Eel, yeah. Not an improvement.~
@2855 = ~You're not funny, slug.~
@2856 = ~Oh, you finally thought of an invertebrate. Good job.~
@2857 = ~And it proves how stupid men are that they can talk to me like that and then wonder why their face gets broken.~
@2858 = ~Talk to you like what? Like this? *ahem*~
@2859 = ~YOUR MOTHER SHARTED AN EEL WHEN YOU WERE BORN.~
@2860 = ~You cocky little gobshite!~
@2861 = ~I hear women hold the leash where you come from, Vynd.~
@2862 = ~One of a dozen reasons why I don't miss the place. What about it?~
@2863 = ~Nothing. I just wanted to picture it. I can see you now, whipped and whimpering, squirming in the mud where you belong. It's a good thought. Maybe I'll fall asleep to it. ~
@2864 = ~You should visit sometime. I bet they'd love to have you.~
@2865 = ~Skie, I look at you and certain words come to mind. "Lockpicker. Skirmisher. Trapfinder. Competent."~
@2866 = ~Basically everything but those four.~
@2867 = ~Thank you! I'd hate to think I look the part for this. All...coarse, covered in dirt and grease. It's great having the skills, but eww.~
@2868 = ~I'm surprised you find time to practice between manicures.~
@2869 = ~Oh, I *know*. It's a nightmare keeping these things tidy. Especially out roughing it like this.~
@2870 = ~Yours are beautiful, by the way. Share some tips?~
@2871 = ~Okay, you realise I'm taking the piss, right? Are you messing with me?~
@2872 = ~Vynd, can I do something with your hair? Just for a minute?~
@2873 = ~Wh...no. No you can't. Go away.~
@2874 = ~Aww, please? I've been dying to spruce it up the minute I saw you. You'd look so cute with a little braid just here...~
@2875 = ~Eldoth! Get a shorter leash, will you? She's humping my leg again.~
@2876 = ~Oh, Tiax, shut the hell up.~
@2877 = ~Or else I'll take a dagger and I'll strut the hell up.~
@2878 = ~You can't rule over nothin' when you're cut the hell up.~
@2879 = ~So, Tiax, shut the hell up.~
@2880 = ~Vynd. Tiax has decided how you may serve him.~
@2881 = ~Vynd advises Tiax to recall Vynd's jaunty rhyme.~
@2882 = ~Tiax has overlooked your insolence, for it brought him a revelation.~
@2883 = ~When Tiax comes to power, there are those who will protest. Tiax has not the patience for squashing rebels. He requires an instrument of silence, and you are well suited. Where dissent grows, your blade shall reap! So Tiax decrees.~
@2884 = ~...really?~
@2885 = ~Really. After Cyric crowns you, I will personally murder everyone in the world, including myself, free of charge.~
@2886 = ~Not everyone, you fool! Only those who oppose Tiax!~
@2887 = ~You, male. I've had my fill of dry rations for the day. Find me something fresh to eat.~
@2888 = ~Oh no. You can't pull that on me anymore. Surface world, surface rules. From what I can tell, it's men who run the show up here, so how about YOU find ME something fresh, FEMALE?~
@2889 = ~What.~
@2890 = ~...orrr we could respect one another as equals. That could...also...you know what, I'm not even hungry. Forget it. Just forget it.~
@2891 = ~Oloth zha?~ [%tutu_var%VICON19]
@2892 = ~Oloth zha. Jaluk. Wael. Rivvil. Look at me, everyone! I use drow words on the surface even though I know the common equivalent!~
@2893 = ~And then I have to explain them anyway because nobody knows what they mean. I'm so goddamned better than you.~
@2894 = ~This is why we don't let males speak freely. There is nothing of value to hear.~
@2895 = ~I'll drink to that.~
@2896 = ~So what drew you into the blazing sun, Vynd? A soft heart? Following in Drizzt's footsteps, perhaps?~
@2897 = ~No, no, a thousand times no. I didn't like the Underdark, so I left. End of story.~
@2898 = ~Oh? Was our society too harsh for you? I might have guessed, the way you carry yourself. You were *born* with the surface in you.~
@2899 = ~I'm sorry, is it my imagination or are you up here as well?~
@2900 = ~Unlike you, I was...there were other circumstances. I did not leave by choice.~
@2901 = ~Uh-huh. So I walked out, and you ran screaming. By drow logic, I'm the coward. By grown-up logic...~
@2902 = ~Enough. I don't know what possessed me to ask. Certainly not interest.~
@2903 = ~*siiigh*~
@2904 = ~*SIIIIIGH*~
@2905 = ~*SIIIIIIIIIIGHHHUUUUUUHHH*~
@2906 = ~See, these other morons can't relate. But us elves, man. We know the score. Right?~
@2907 = ~Fool.~
@2908 = ~That's a moonblade, isn't it?~
@2909 = ~You recognise it. Then you know it will not avail you to steal it.~
@2910 = ~Sure. No worries there. But I also know they have to judge you before you can use them, right? A test of character. If you don't pass, you get incinerated.~
@2911 = ~So, all offense intended, how are you still alive?~
@2912 = ~A question I've asked myself once or twice. Perhaps you've noticed.~
@2913 = ~Daahhh, tell me about the raaaabbits!~ [%tutu_var%XZARR23]
@2914 = ~I wonder sometimes if you're really crazy or just looking for attention.~
@2915 = ~You've got the mood swings, the paranoia, the creepy obsession with death; that all seems genuine. But then you start ranting about rabbits and putting on silly voices and it feels like you're trying too hard.~
@2916 = ~But I do so love rabbits, Vynd. Their precious little feet twitch for hours even after...hee hee...even after I'm done.~
@2917 = ~And then you pull it back to authenticity again. You're a mystery, Xzar.~
@2918 = ~Thank you most kindly.~
@2919 = ~Psst. Montaron. Watch this.~
@2920 = ~Xzar! They know! They know everything and they're coming for us!~
@2921 = ~OH GODS!~
@2922 = ~Heh. Done it before, but it no gets old.~
@2923 = ~Vynd, I'll not be swingin' axes over the tone of yer skin, but the tone of yer voice, perhaps. Ye could stand to be a mite more respectful.~
@2924 = ~Yeah? Well you could stand to be a mite less short, fat, hairy, sweaty, disgusting...~
@2925 = ~This be what I mean.~
@2926 = ~Dumb, drunken, ale-breathed, brown-toothed, dirt-heaping, rock-humping stumpball deserving nothing from the world but contempt and death.~
@2927 = ~Finished?~
@2928 = ~Yeah, sorry. I was a little backed up.~
@2929 = ~So an elf and a dwarf walk into a bar...~
@2930 = ~Heard it.~
@2931 = ~What do you mean "heard it"? There's dozens of these.~
@2932 = ~Heard 'em all.~
@2933 = ~Twenty gold.~
@2934 = ~Thirty. Thirty gold. Come on, nobody else will know.~
@2935 = ~I'm nay that kind of dwarf.~
@2936 = ~Yes, and that's why it'll be amazing. That's the whole point.~
@2937 = ~You could donate it somewhere.~
@2938 = ~Does Clangeddin have any temples? Shrines? They can have it. All you need to do-~
@2939 = ~I NEED A SWIG O' SOME STRONG,~
@2940 = ~DWARRRRRRVEN ALE.~
@2941 = ~Beautiful.~
@2942 = ~Do "By Moradin's hammer!"~
@2943 = ~Ye can't afford it.~
@2944 = ~That's now how to do it.~
@2945 = ~It's how everyone does it.~
@2946 = ~It's how idiots do it. You go across like that, you'll miss the jugular.~
@2947 = ~But they still wouldn't be able to breathe. Right? They'd still die.~
@2948 = ~Not guaranteed. Trust me.~
@2949 = ~If you want to be sure, make a right angle. In from the side, out through the front. Nobody walks away from that.~
@2950 = ~Only amateurs slit throats. Professionals gouge them out.~
@2951 = ~Wow. It's times like this I wish I was allowed to use a knife.~
@2952 = ~How do you cut your meat?~
@2953 = ~I don't. I just sort of...mangle it.~
@2954 = ~Do you think murder is wrong, Vynd?~
@2955 = ~...you do know what my job is, right? I haven't been shy about it.~
@2956 = ~Oh, I know. I was just wondering, do you think it's right to do what you do? Or do you think it's wrong and not care?~
@2957 = ~I don't philosophise. I just do it.~
@2958 = ~Maybe you should. It'd change a lot of lives if people stopped to ask @324 /* Why? */ every so often.~
@2959 = ~How many steps have you taken?~
@2960 = ~Steps? From where?~
@2961 = ~From when you learned how to walk. In total.~
@2962 = ~Uh...I don't know.~
@2963 = ~Right. You might take a notion to keep score. Maybe for the next few hundred, you will. But eventually you realise; when it's time to stop counting, who's going to care what the number is?~
@2964 = ~How much does it cost to have someone killed?~
@2965 = ~Depends who it is. You have someone in mind?~
@2966 = ~Not really. I'm just being nosey. I've never met an assassin before.~
@2967 = ~You probably have.~
@2968 = ~There's a lot of weight in the word "assassin". Lot of images. Mysterious rogues stalking the rooftops with black cloaks and masks. It's all garbage. An assassin is someone who murders for money. That's it. If an innkeeper takes five gold to slip something into a drink, he's an assassin.~
@2969 = ~But most innkeepers wouldn't do that.~
@2970 = ~For five gold? No. But once the number's high enough...~
@2971 = ~If I went up to the next innkeeper we met and said "I'll pay you a million gold to poison that man", he wouldn't do it. I bet you he wouldn't.~
@2972 = ~Of course not, because you don't have a million gold and he knows it. But if you *show* him a million gold...well now. I suppose it's just this once. And this iron crisis damn near put me out of business. I have mouths to feed, don't I?~
@2973 = ~Now even then, he might do it, or he might not. But he's not asking if it's right or wrong anymore. He's asking if he can get away with it.~
@2974 = ~By that point, the only difference between him and me is I've had more practice.~
@2975 = ~So. Are you gonna make us call you Stormlord now?~
@2976 = ~Would you do it?~
@2977 = ~No, but I'll have less respect for you if you don't even try.~
@2978 = ~Any chance to be a contrarian, eh?~
@2979 = ~Hah. Not that I'm denying it, but you're one to talk. You joined a church of Talos just to vent some adolescent spite at your humdrum existence, then stuck with it so long you ended up running the place. You're a more dedicated contrarian than I'll ever be.~
@2980 = ~Speaking of which...I guess now that you're in charge, you'll need to take a more involved role in spreading the fear of Talos. Extend your reach, so to speak.~
@2981 = ~Suddenly I feel like this is going somewhere.~
@2982 = ~You know where absolutely nobody fears Talos? The Underdark. Especially in the drow cities. That's Lolth's turf, all the way. Nobody so much as spares a thought for surfacer gods.~
@2983 = ~If you had a couple of priests to spare, I could take them down with me, give them a little tour...maybe teach the locals that lightning *can* strike underground. ~
@2984 = ~Ah. I see.~
@2985 = ~There'll be a few conditions, obviously.~
@2986 = ~Nothing comes free. Hit me.~
@2987 = ~The first is that you have to start calling me Stormlord.~
@2988 = ~...well played.~
@2989 = ~Braaiins.~
@2990 = ~Tentacleeees.~
@2991 = ~Flarbhglgrgharghfflbg.~
@2992 = ~What in Asgorath's name are you doing?~
@2993 = ~I'm a mind flayer, Flara. Trapped in the body of a drow. Isn't it obvious?~
@2994 = ~I've known for a while now. One time back home, I watched a disobedient slave being scalped, and suddenly I was overcome by this terrible hunger...~
@2995 = ~Oh, am I to chastise you now? Au contraire, I believe it. You certainly diminish our intelligence.~
@2996 = ~Hey Flara. Did someone bump you twice on the head, or are those...?~
@2997 = ~Horns. Or the beginnings of them, at least.~
@2998 = ~Not so derisive now, are we? I await your crow-eating with bated breath, and you'd do well to note the implication in my phrasing.~
@2999 = ~Horns doesn't mean dragon. It just means not-human. Lots of things have horns. Maybe there's an antelope inside you, screaming to get out.~
@3000 = ~A fire-breathing antelope.~
@3001 = ~The things wizards get up to, right? First they threw owls and bears in bed together with a bottle of wine and waited for desperation to run its course, now this? I swear, it's like nobody can pick up a spellbook these days without blaspheming against nature.~
@3002 = ~Don't worry, though. You have my full support. Next time we're in the woods, if you feel like stepping away for a quick graze, I'll watch your back.~
@3003 = ~I believe I have decided to write a list. ~
@3004 = ~A list of...?~
@3005 = ~That is for me to know. Suffice it to say, your name shall be at the top.~
@3006 = ~You were very quick to accept <CHARNAME>'s divinity, drow.~
@3007 = ~I tried to think of a reason why <PRO_HISHER> old man would lie about it. All I could come up with was "Because it would be hilarious." And Gorion was apparently the opposite of me, so I doubt that's it.~
@3008 = ~Besides, it adds up. The strange powers, the nightmares, the mysterious past...~
@3009 = ~And yet despite everything lending credence to my own claims, you have nothing but contempt for them.~
@3010 = ~Flara, if <PRO_HESHE> ever starts harping on it as much as you, I guarantee I'll be there to take <PRO_HIMHER> down a peg. Even if <PRO_HESHE> somehow *became* Bhaal, <PRO_HESHE> would lie awake wondering where the voice comes from, that sneering voice that whispers heresies to <PRO_HIMHER> in the night. And one day, <PRO_HESHE>'d look in the shadow of <PRO_HISHER> throne and find me.~
@3011 = ~For all I know, you are a dragon. For all you know, I believe it. But it doesn't matter what you are. Only what you do.~
@3012 = ~So this, apparently, is my life now. Aimless puttering around every settlement in the Coast, solving crimes and righting wrongs with the world's most wanted bookworm and a walking inferiority complex.~
@3013 = ~I ain't got a complex, ya grey-cheeked jacksy.~
@3014 = ~No? You grew up, and I use that term loosely, among the elegant, ageless, otherworldly Fair Folk, and you never find yourself struck with feelings of inadequacy? You with your hairy little feet and your stubby arms that can't even use a real bow? If you *don't* have a complex, there's something wrong with you.~
@3015 = ~Elegant? Otherworldly? Them's the words of an outsider looking in. Spending my life with elves just means I've seen more elves make an arse of themselves than any other race in Faerun. They're people. That's all they are. Ancient, long-lived people, *my* people, but still just people, with all the faults that people have.~
@3016 = ~Now. How about you hold still while I sink a few quarrels in your knees, and then you can tell me again that this ain't a real bow.~
@3017 = ~Actually, I take that back. I don't need you to hold still.~
@3018 = ~I think I like you.~
@3019 = ~Oh gods.~
@3020 = ~You're good with that crossbow.~
@3021 = ~What do you want?~
@3022 = ~What do I want? What's that supposed to mean? Can't I pay a simple compliment to my teammate?~
@3023 = ~You'd charge ten gold apiece for a "simple compliment" and we both know it. What do you want?~
@3024 = ~I was just thinking I'd like to take you to the Underdark.~
@3025 = ~See this halfling, everybody? This waela sakphul? Better shot than any of you with a fifth the practice time. Say "the drow rule supreme" for me.~
@3026 = ~That's a compliment, is it? That I'd make a good spectacle? Little circus animal for you to show your mates?~
@3027 = ~It's about as much as I'll ever value anyone, so yeah.~
@3028 = ~If you don't like it, pay me ten gold and I'll tell you your hair's pretty.~
@3029 = ~Sod off.~
@3030 = ~How'd you feel if I shot you, Vynd?~
@3031 = ~Already I'm not sure I want to have this conversation.~
@3032 = ~Imagine I just snuffed you out right here, without a word of warning. You think you'd be happy about it?~
@3033 = ~Would it get me out of discussing this with you?~
@3034 = ~I'll go ahead and assume you wouldn't. Now, if you were thinking about putting *me* to sleep...~
@3035 = ~Oh, Plunkett. I would charge at least double my normal rate for you. Maybe triple if it weren't for the moralising.~
@3036 = ~If ever that crossed your mind, you could think how you'd feel first. Then you think, "If I wouldn't want her to do that to me, perhaps I shouldn't do it to her."~
@3037 = ~You know, I legitimately respect you being able to walk away from your people. Rebellion takes guts. And brains.~
@3038 = ~Treating people how you'd like to be treated. That's called being a decent person. That's how most of us like to do things up here. And as you're sticking around surface-wise, maybe you should give it a go.~
@3039 = ~You get called "bull-headed" a lot, don't you?~
@3040 = ~Look. Plunkett. I kill who I'm paid to kill. Nobody pays me to kill children or puppies or whatever innocent souls you weep for, because nobody needs my help to do that. You're preaching to the wrong person.~
@3041 = ~But if they did pay you, you'd do it.~
@3042 = ~But it doesn't happen, so what's the problem?~
@3043 = ~You really don't know, do you? You really don't understand why that matters.~
@3044 = ~Remember you said you want to take me to the Underdark? Ain't happening. I think I'd rather die.~
@3045 = ~Hey, now there's a topic. Let's talk about how lousy the Underdark is. That sounds much more fun.~
@3046 = ~Hey Plunkett. Remember that gnome we met in prison? The child killer?~
@3047 = ~I'll be remembering his putrid face for the rest of my life. And if you're about to start in with your stupid, hateful jokes, I swear by all the Seldarine I'll-~
@3048 = ~Want me to do him?~
@3049 = ~He enjoys himself more than he should, that one. People like him, the "aficionados", they're always too lost in the thrill to notice the breadcrumbs they leave behind. I could track him down overnight. ~
@3050 = ~This whole thing with <CHARNAME> is on its last legs. It'd be smart to have a job or two waiting once it peters out, no? We can sit down over some drinks, work out a colleague's discount...I won't even ask anything up front, since I know you're too dumb to think about welching.~
@3051 = ~Alright, what's the game here?~
@3052 = ~No game. This isn't play, Plunkett. This is work. Never mix 'em.~
@3053 = ~I ain't rich. I ain't powerful. Any coin I paid in wouldn't buy more than a loaf of bread, and any favours would either be something you don't need or something you know damn well I wouldn't do. So tell me what you'd get out of this, because if it was nothing, you wouldn't have asked.~
@3054 = ~Maybe I just want to make a point.~
@3055 = ~Those kids weren't anyone important. If they were, their killer would have been caught sooner. And they didn't do anything to deserve it, because they're kids, and that's impossible. They're dead just because someone thought it would be fun to kill them. Complete waste of life. No aftermath beyond a few dozen wailing mothers.~
@3056 = ~It's hideous. You think I don't get it, but I do. I see why it bothers you. It just doesn't bother me. That's the way I am, Plunkett. Nothing I can say about that.~
@3057 = ~What I can say is that I don't like that gnome one bit, with his annoying riddles and his pretentious self-admiration as if slaughtering street rats is some kind of accomplishment, and I wouldn't mind tying a wire round his neck. So. There you go. There, at last, is a little accord we have. And if you ever want to make something of that, I'm ready. Just say the word.~
@3058 = ~...I will.~
@3059 = ~Can't say I have. Wouldn't much care to either.~
@3060 = ~No? Never considered going back?~
@3061 = ~Oops. Did I say going back? I meant going. Visiting. For the first time.~
@3062 = ~Because you've never actually been in the Underdark before. Right?~
@3063 = ~Uh-huh.~
@3064 = ~Alright, enough playing coy. You're a duergar.~
@3065 = ~I am not.~
@3066 = ~You are. It's so obvious. It was funny at first, watching you try to hide it, everyone humouring you, but it's gone beyond a joke now. Just come clean. You've got that helmet, you never take it off...~
@3067 = ~For safety.~
@3068 = ~You never show any skin at *all*, even on hot days...~
@3069 = ~I'm a bodyguard, not a whore.~
@3070 = ~Look, I don't care if you're a duergar. I'm from the Underdark as well. I don't give a damn. HELLO EVERYONE, I'M A DROW! See how easy that is?~
@3071 = ~Hello Vynd. I'm a dwarf. Shut up.~
@3072 = ~Hah! I saw that!~
@3073 = ~Back of your neck. Just now, when you rubbed your shoulder. A teeny little glimpse of grey skin. Now tell me, Moidre. What kind of person is short, stubby, hideously broad and grey-skinned?~
@3074 = ~Your mother?~
@3075 = ~DUER-~
@3076 = ~Hey. Uncalled for.~
@3077 = ~Greetings. I hope you're not attending just for the spectacle. You'll find your stay here quite instructive, if you're prepared to listen.~
@3078 = ~Why do you worship Talos?~
@3079 = ~Farewell.~
@3080 = ~Die, Talassan!~
@3081 = ~There was a time I didn't. Not so long ago, perhaps, but I'd swear it's been decades. I was an Oghmanyte, once. I pledged myself as a scholar of the divine, to travel the world and chronicle its faiths and pantheons.~
@3082 = ~A colourful journey, while it lasted. I've studied with Mystrans, revelled with Llirians and even supped with Talonites, a mistake I'll not soon repeat. But in the end, all I truly learned was this.~
@3083 = ~It's pointless. There are kind gods and cruel gods, forever heaving in their tug of war, while indifferent gods watch. From the dawn of man, nothing has changed, and to the dusk of man, nothing will. Ought we not merely do as we please?~
@3084 = ~Have you tried the scones? I must say, they're marvellous.~
@3085 = ~Say, Alan. You didn't commission a group of fishermen to kill a priestess of Umberlee, did you?~
@3086 = ~Me? Whyever would I do that? We have a truce with the Umberlants, do we not?~
@3087 = ~Not anymore we don't.~
@3088 = ~Look at this oaf. The triumph of brawn over brains, made manifest. It's times like this I wish the concept of justice was more than a comforting lie...~
@3089 = ~Are the contestants ready to commence?~
@3090 = ~Speak the prayers and be quick about it. I wish this over as soon as possible.~
@3091 = ~Let the Trial begin! Contestants, beseech the grace of the almighty Talos, for only through his favour may you weather this storm!~
@3092 = ~Talos. I am, and have ever been, your humble servant. Let the history of my deeds and my knowledge of your strictures prove my conviction, and may you strike this weakling from my sight forevermore...~
@3093 = ~This reminds me of the time with that courier.~
@3094 = ~Hah! It was worth sitting that one out just to see the look on his face.~
@3095 = ~I was thinking more about when Brian accidentally hit me.~
@3096 = ~How do you know it was me? You was blindfolded.~
@3097 = ~Only you could ever miss that badly, Brian.~
@3098 = ~Well then. What next, Stormlord?~
@3099 = ~...are you talking to me?~
@3100 = ~To whom else would I be talking? You defeated Taranis, did you not? Going by his rules, that should make you Stormherald, but seeing as you didn't kill him, perhaps we should split the difference.~
@3101 = ~Makes sense to me.~
@3102 = ~Stormlord Dave!~
@3103 = ~Whoa, whoa! I never agreed to this!~
@3104 = ~Why not? No offence to those assembled, o' course, but I'd pick you before any of these mugs. Besides, now Stormlord Jeff's gone, you're the only one left who Thundercat will listen to. Someone's gotta keep her on the leash, eh?~
@3105 = ~*meow*~
@3106 = ~Talos chose you, Dave! You can't back down now!~
@3107 = ~Listen! Everyone just listen for a moment. I'm glad you all feel this way, and I'm not saying I don't want to do it, but these are some very big shoes to fill. I really don't know if I...~
@3108 = ~A most enlightening experience. I never imagined I'd have the privilege to oversee a Trial. Then again, I never imagined myself doing a great many things. Perhaps I should imagine more often. ~
@3109 = ~You're the ones Dave brung in? You're probably alright, then.~
@3110 = ~Well. I ain't much good with numbers, so the shopkeeps wouldn't have me. I ain't much good with me hands, so the smiths wouldn't neither. Tried joining the military, but I couldn't get the feel for a bow. Shot meself in the foot once, even.~
@3111 = ~Stormlord Jeff said none of that mattered to Talos. It's what's in here that counts.~
@3112 = ~Then he started laughing and said nah, not really. But you don't need sums to pray, and no-one can miss a man in mail with a lightning bolt.~
@3113 = ~Here, has anyone seen my helmet?~
@3114 = ~Where is it? I swore I just had it...~
@3115 = ~I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.~
@3116 = ~Dun like him. Dun like him one bit.~
@3117 = ~I'm glad we got a new Stormlord. Dunno where I'd be without someone to shout at me.~
@3118 = ~Here. Is this the temple of Talos?~
@3119 = ~Er, yes, it is, but now's not really a good-~
@3120 = ~Harry here says you been killing bandits.~
@3121 = ~I saw it, I did! Thieving bastards never stood a chance!~
@3122 = ~Those stinking bandits shook the last copper from me pockets! Made off with me best sheep, too! If I could've chucked lightning like you lot...!~
@3123 = ~Teach us!~
@3124 = ~Yeah, teach us!~
@3125 = ~Fools! The Destroyer is not a generous god! Such gifts must be *earned*! Do you truly think you have the will to wield the storm?!~
@3126 = ~I have eight children. EIGHT. If I can handle that, I can handle anything.~
@3127 = ~So be it! Be seated, ye rabble, and mark well the word of TALOS!~
@3128 = ~Hello, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! How are you today? If I had to guess, I'd say spectacular!~
@3129 = ~You guess correctly.~
@3130 = ~I'm alright, I suppose.~
@3131 = ~Actually, I'm miserable.~
@3132 = ~Can't you see I'm covered in blood?~
@3133 = ~That's great! But if I had fifty gold coins, I'd bet I can make your day even better.~
@3134 = ~Just an average day, then? That might be about to change!~
@3135 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But don't worry! I have some good news that might cheer you up.~
@3136 = ~Er...yes. But you wear it so well! And from the looks of you, I'd say it's not all yours, am I right?~
@3137 = ~My name's Dave. Nice to meet you. Can I ask if you're worshipping any gods at the moment?~
@3138 = ~You don't have to convert me. I worship Talos as well.~
@3139 = ~Yes I am.~
@3140 = ~None in particular, no.~
@3141 = ~What kind of question is that?~
@3142 = ~I don't see how that's your business.~
@3143 = ~Ah, but are you really? I'm sure you say your prayers, but that's not what I asked.~
@3144 = ~Be honest; do you feel like they have a real presence in your life? Can you truly say you're a believer, or are you just following a load of annoying rules so you don't have to admit you're faithless?~
@3145 = ~Being a cleric, I'd say my god has quite a strong presence in my life.~
@3146 = ~Being a paladin, I'd say my god has quite a strong presence in my life.~
@3147 = ~No. I've always found my religion fulfilling.~
@3148 = ~I do feel that way sometimes.~
@3149 = ~I don't think I like what you're implying.~
@3150 = ~Aha! And why might that be? Not looking to tie yourself up in strictures? Maybe those stuffy local gods of farming and sunlight aren't exciting enough? Or are you just undecided? Whatever the problem, I might have the solution.~
@3151 = ~Sorry, was that too invasive? I don't usually get past the "Hello, how are you?" bit. Let me just make a note...~
@3152 = ~Oh. You're actually pledged yourself to someone? Well. That's...great. Make my life difficult, why don't you. Ha ha. I've got nothing prepared for this at all.~
@3153 = ~Typical, isn't it? The one person today who's stopped and talked to me is already spoken for. I'd say Talos is playing a joke on me, but I don't think he'd find this funny.~
@3154 = ~Wait. You worship the Storm God?~
@3155 = ~Talos? Shouldn't you be threatening people and throwing lightning around?~
@3156 = ~Really? You've never had any doubts? Any confusion? You've never said "If my god's so powerful, why can't he or she do such and such?" Nothing like that?~
@3157 = ~Now that you put it like that, I suppose I do have such thoughts.~
@3158 = ~We all do. And some people spend their whole lives trying to find a way out. But you? You're about to have one put right in your hands.~
@3159 = ~Sorry, was that too presumptuous? I don't usually get past the "Hello, how are you?" bit. Let me just make a note...~
@3160 = ~I'll get straight to the point. I'm a priest of Talos, and I'm here today to tell you about the many, MANY reasons why worshipping the Destroyer might just be the greatest decision you'll ever...~
@3161 = ~I do, but I'm not here to cause trouble. Not now, anyway.~
@3162 = ~I'm just trying out something new. I thought maybe if I inform rather than intimidate, I might get a few people to worship Talos on their own terms instead of just being afraid of him. So far it hasn't worked, but the <DAYNIGHT>'s still young, so...~
@3163 = ~Aw, what? At least wait for me to do something bad!~
@3164 = ~Huh. So much for that approach, then.~
@3165 = ~You know, I really thought everyone went through that at some point. Now I'm worried I might be projecting. Or are you just the exception to the rule? I have no idea! You're the only person who's talked to me today. I'll tell you, evangelising for Talos is not an easy job.~
@3166 = ~Oh! Of course, I should've realised. Sometimes you get so caught up in talking that you don't notice who you're actually talking to. You know how it is.~
@3167 = ~That's typical though, isn't it? The one person who stops and listens to me is the one who doesn't need to hear it. Not that I'm not happy to meet you, but...~
@3168 = ~Alright, sunshine. That's enough out of you.~
@3169 = ~Sorry, officer? Is there a problem?~
@3170 = ~Don't play innocent. I'll not have you threatening the good citizens of Beregost. Stop harassing this <PRO_MANWOMAN> and come with me.~
@3171 = ~He wasn't harassing me. We're just talking.~
@3172 = ~You're arresting him? What for? What has he done?~
@3173 = ~He threatened me! He said he'd crush me under his iron boot if I didn't fall to my knees and praise Talos!~
@3174 = ~Just talking? With him? You realise he's a Talassan, don't you? You mean to say he called you over for a nice chat?~
@3175 = ~He's a Talassan. I've seen that symbol before, and it means no good for anyone. What are you up to, sonny? ~
@3176 = ~What?! I never...I didn't...my boots aren't even made of iron!~
@3177 = ~RIGHT. End of the road for you, my lad. Let's see how the rest of the prisoners like your preaching.~
@3178 = ~Handing out parchments and answering questions, sir. I swear by Talos, that's all I'm doing.~
@3179 = ~See, if I was lying, there would have been some lightning just now.~
@3180 = ~Well, you'd...you'd best just be careful, then. I've got my eye on you.~
@3181 = ~And that's why you can't always go in bolts blazing. If I'd started proclaiming doom and abuse, he'd have had all the reason he needed to put my head in a basket.~
@3182 = ~You do seem like an unusual Talassan.~
@3183 = ~I'd have fought him off. Any chance to stick it to those prigs.~
@3184 = ~I can't say I approve of Talos, but I wouldn't have you arrested just for speaking of him.~
@3185 = ~Not to be snide, but have you met many? If there's such a thing as a "usual" Talassan, I don't know what it is yet.~
@3186 = ~Ho ho! That might have been fun, but I really am trying to keep things civil for now. Just to see how it goes.~
@3187 = ~Do you know how much easier my life would be if everyone felt that way? I swear, people are so wound up sometimes...~
@3188 = ~I'd better move along. Thanks for helping, but if I stay here, they'll just come back and arrest me for "loitering" or some other stupid thing they'd never normally bother with.~
@3189 = ~Why not come with me? I could use a good cleric.~
@3190 = ~Good luck to you, then.~
@3191 = ~Don't come back.~
@3192 = ~But I'm not a good cleric.~
@3193 = ~Oh, you mean a *skilled* cleric. Sure! I'm...skilled. I think. That sounds great. I'll make a convert of you yet! Hah, only joking.~
@3194 = ~Oh, you mean a *skilled* cleric. Sure! I'm...skilled. I think. It'll be great to have another Talassan around. Safety in numbers, eh?~
@3195 = ~It's not you, <CHARNAME>. I've knocked on his door once or twice before and he was exactly this grumpy every time. Probably cabin fever.~
@3196 = ~THALAN~ ~On the contrary, a spell of cabin fever may be just the remedy I need. Would that I were allowed the chance to find out.~
@3197 = ~Ahh. Classic mistake. If you're going to rob the dead, do it before they're buried. Always gets complicated once the rot sets in.~
@3198 = ~HENTOL~ ~My thieving days are over, and I'll swear it to any god that would grant me peace!~
@3199 = ~I almost want to cross him now, just to see if he can really do that.~
@3200 = ~500? Even our temple sells them cheaper than that. You've actually out-crooked the Talassans. Amazing.~
@3201 = ~I didn't realise the sewers here had so much to see. Talking slimes, carrion crawlers, an underground festhall...they should give tours.~
@3202 = ~Ugh. Leirans. I hope you're a patient <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>, because this'll feel like threading needles with your feet.~
@3203 = ~I'd say that was pointless, but then she'd just act like being pointless was somehow the point. Ooh. So mysterious.~
@3204 = ~*sigh* How come "girls like bad boys" applies to everyone except me?~
@3205 = ~Ah, the old "If you kill me, you're no better than me" routine. I tried that on a group of Helmies once.~
@3206 = ~It, uh...didn't work. At all.~
@3207 = ~TELANO~ ~I'll have a hawk's eye on you, <CHARNAME>, from this moment forward. Be wary.~
@3208 = ~Oh gods. I'm getting flashbacks.~
@3209 = ~People never learn, do they? Bargaining with demons is like tossing a coin and betting it lands on its side.~
@3210 = ~Hmm. What do you think the trick is? Illusions? Some kind of regeneration magic? Maybe just a huge supply of expendable ogres?~
@3211 = ~It's not illusions.~
@3212 = ~Really? How can you tell?~
@3213 = ~Splash zone.~
@3214 = ~I could learn a thing or two here. I know he's talking nonsense and I still sort of want to go along with it.~
@3215 = ~You don't need no help talking nonsense, from what I've seen.~
@3216 = ~Is there a food stand anywhere?~
@3217 = ~Oh boy. If you're going to pretend to worship Cyric, can you not implicate me as well? I risked some heavy smiting by not correcting you there.~
@3218 = ~I remember Phil saying he had that problem before he joined Talos. Apparently a little marauding put the spring back in his, uh, step. Gets the juices flowing, he says. He must be right. He has triplets now.~
@3219 = ~I had my suspicions, and this confirms them. Jalantha. You don't recognise me, do you?~
@3220 = ~JALANT~ ~I remember your face well enough, Talassan, but do not overvalue our "alliance." Your familiarity quells the whim to have you drowned in the sea. Nothing more.~
@3221 = ~You remember me, but you do not *recognise* me. I am Stormlord now, and you would do well to consider that before you choose your next words.~
@3222 = ~JALANT~ ~Pfah! Stormlord? A knock-kneed acolyte is my memory of you, and precious little has changed since. You are no more a Stormlord than I am Umberlee herself.~
@3223 = ~I am, and the very fact that I still live to say so is proof! You know well what befalls those among our gods who pretend to authority!~
@3224 = ~JALANT~ ~Stormlord or no, you are a long ways from your church, and a very short ways indeed from mine! This place is Umberlee's, and those inside will show RESPECT, no matter what emblem hangs on their pale necks!~
@3225 = ~This place stands because Talos wills it so! Think you that Umberlee has strength enough to hold these walls against his fury? Do you TEST the Destroyer to bring this temple crashing down on your skull?! Are we at last to shed this frail facade of friendship and SUBSUME your broken faith in the tides of conquest?!~
@3226 = ~JALANT~ ~INSOLENT, FLEDGLING BRAT! I WILL NOT BE THREATENED IN THE VERY HOME OF MY GODDESS!~
@3227 = ~THEN YOU WILL BE *BURIED* IN IT!~
@3228 = ~JALANT~ ~I see you've found a spine somewhere along the way.~
@3229 = ~A spine, a flock, and the meanest cat in Faerun. Don't make me use them.~
@3230 = ~This is all too volatile for me. I'll find another way to deal with this.~
@3231 = ~Let's keep things civil here. I'll get you the book you need.~
@3232 = ~A simple spell, or a potential feud with the Talassans. Your choice, High Priestess.~
@3233 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>? After all that?~
@3234 = ~Nobody will know you did this for us. In fact, I'll tell people you threw me to a pack of sharks and made me swim for my life just for asking.~
@3235 = ~JALANT~ ~Take it, then, but do not expect any favours for a long time to come. You have pushed me but an inch, and I will yield no more ground.~
@3236 = ~I'm a werewolf now? This is amazing! Wait till everyone back at the temple hears this!~
@3237 = ~Why would a healer be found in a whorehouse? Maybe because the diseases breed more than the workers do. Or maybe for the same reasons as anyone else.~
@3238 = ~Miss, I can already tell you're trying to wrap us around your finger for your own fiendish ends, and I can assure you that I absolutely, one hundred percent, do not care.~
@3239 = ~Fancy a drink? Of, uh...water?~
@3240 = ~Are you out of your mind, Dave?~
@3241 = ~Just let me have this!~
@3242 = ~Kind of presumptuous to think you'd be "wasting your charms", isn't it? I know at least one woman who'd do *anything* you asked her to. Better not tell her about this place, actually...~
@3243 = ~Oh, I've tried this one before. It never works.~
@3244 = ~How about the rest of us get a room for the night and you can meet us when you're done here?~
@3245 = ~You just said our passage would be quicker! Not that I'm surprised an assassin lied, but why even bother asking, then?~
@3246 = ~Wow. If only we caught all ogres at lunch time.~
@3247 = ~Imagine having a temple big enough to rent out the rooms. Let people spend the night, then call down a storm so they have to stay, get some drinks and a sermon in them...this already sounds like the best idea I've ever had.~
@3248 = ~Wow. The routine really fell apart towards the end there.~
@3249 = ~Heh. "Little choice", he says, but no mention of a prize for taking him alive. Have to keep up appearances, I suppose.~
@3250 = ~...or maybe a wizard did it.~
@3251 = ~Should I tell him, or would it be funnier to leave him blissfully ignorant?~
@3252 = ~Huh. Normally I have to wave my symbol at them first. Should I do it anyway? Make him extra friendly?~
@3253 = ~Well don't look at me. If this were my idea, I'd have said something earlier.~
@3254 = ~Ah, don't worry, <CHARNAME>. I'll smooth it over with him. These three are *really* overestimating how important they are. ~
@3255 = ~Oof. To think I actually considered joining these lunatics. You know you're in dire straits when *Cyric* is your best prospect.~
@3256 = ~Uh, I'll do it. If nobody else wants to. Nobody else wants to, do they?~
@3257 = ~Heh.~
@3258 = ~What? What's funny?~
@3259 = ~Nothing. Suck her tonsils out, Dave. I believe in you.~
@3260 = ~SHOAL~ ~Now then...~
@3261 = ~Eugh. Why scalps? This is disgusting.~
@3262 = ~No different from skinning an animal. And I mean that both ways.~
@3263 = ~What's wrong, Dave? Can't handle a little floppy, slimy, hairy, severed flesh?~
@3264 = ~Scalp fight!~
@3265 = ~No! No! No!~
@3266 = ~Give it here and give over. Hells bells. Children twice my height, the pair of you.~
@3267 = ~I still say this is disgusting. Of all the bits she could have asked for...~
@3268 = ~Dave. Name another body part that comes off neat, that fits nicely in a satchel, that wouldn't look the same if it came from an animal, and that each man only has one of.~
@3269 = ~Scalps it is.~
@3270 = ~Wow, it feels great to have some company! The missionary work's important for faiths like ours, but you miss having people to talk to.~
@3271 = ~Doesn't the church partner you with someone?~
@3272 = ~This is an odd profession for someone who enjoys socialising.~
@3273 = ~"Faiths like ours"?~
@3274 = ~I miss *not* having people to talk to. Be quiet.~
@3275 = ~Ah, we wouldn't cover enough ground if we went in twos. There aren't that many of us, not that anyone admits it. The "official" reason is that surviving and proselytising on your own helps to strengthen you.~
@3276 = ~Which it does, I suppose. I'm a much faster runner than when I started.~
@3277 = ~I don't know about that. True, you get run out of a lot of towns, but the people you do meet are always more interesting. Quality over quantity, as they say.~
@3278 = ~The more extreme ones, I mean. Most everyone assumes they're a good person, so they'll pop into a church of Lathander or Ilmater every now and then because they're the nice gods. Wishy washy worship. Talos doesn't get much of that.~
@3279 = ~What about you? Life on the road must get lonely sometimes. Er, that's not supposed to be a come-on.~
@3280 = ~I've been lonely ever since I lost my foster father.~
@3281 = ~It's not something I have a choice about. There are people after me.~
@3282 = ~It's better than being stuck in Candlekeep.~
@3283 = ~Ah, that's a shame. I'm guessing it happened recently? It gets better, believe me. You'll never not miss them, but...~
@3284 = ~Really? Are you a criminal, then? Or...~
@3285 = ~Is that where you're from? It probably is better, then. I enjoy a good book, but...~
@3286 = ~Oh! OH! I knew I'd heard your name before! There's a bounty on you, isn't there?~
@3287 = ~Is there?~
@3288 = ~It took you this long to realise?~
@3289 = ~Don't tell me you mean to collect.~
@3290 = ~Keep your voice down!~
@3291 = ~You didn't know? We got one of the notices! The church of Talos! Some courier showed up and said they were addressed to "all those of evil intent." Which includes us, I suppose.~
@3292 = ~No, I mean we got one of the notices! The church of Talos! Some courier showed up and said they were addressed to "all those of evil intent." Which includes us, I suppose.~
@3293 = ~Right, sorry. It's just, we got one of the notices. The church of Talos. Some courier showed up and said they were addressed to "all those of evil intent." Which includes us, I suppose.~
@3294 = ~You needn't worry, though. Stormlord Jeff...that's the cleric in charge...said something like "Talos' faithful are no common bounty hunters, and even if we were, that reward is an insult." And then we electrocuted him. It was quite funny, actually. Strung him up by his ankles, blindfolded ourselves and threw lightning bolts at him, and the first one to score a hit got to keep his things. ~
@3295 = ~That's awful!~
@3296 = ~I should be thanking you, then.~
@3297 = ~I'd have liked to see that.~
@3298 = ~It doesn't sound funny.~
@3299 = ~So is putting a price on your head. Unless you deserved it. And if you did, they'd probably have gone to the Flaming Fist instead of us.~
@3300 = ~You're welcome! Not that we did it for your sake, but you're welcome anyway.~
@3301 = ~Oh, it was brilliant. Scorch marks all over the walls, everyone's hair standing on end afterwards...you have to make things fun, otherwise why even bother? ~
@3302 = ~Maybe you had to be there. In fact, you definitely did.~
@3303 = ~Still, though. Bounty hunters? Whose feathers are you ruffling? For that much gold, you can't just be some nobody from a library.~
@3304 = ~That's what I'm trying to find out.~
@3305 = ~I *am* just some nobody from a library. And I'd very much like to continue being one.~
@3306 = ~I'm not. I'm dangerous. And whoever's after me will soon learn that.~
@3307 = ~I'd prefer not to think about it.~
@3308 = ~Ooh. This'll be a good story to bring back, I bet.~
@3309 = ~I think you'll change your mind. It's only hard now because it's new. It's different. You'd be surprised what you can wrap your head around. Sooner or later, everything becomes normal.~
@3310 = ~I can understand that, but you'll have to face it eventually. Ignoring assassins just makes their job easier.~
@3311 = ~I just realised. I never got to tell you about worshipping Talos, did I? That officer interrupted me. If it's alright with you, can I finish what I was going to say?~
@3312 = ~You're preaching to the choir, remember?~
@3313 = ~I thought you gave up on that when you found out I was a cleric.~
@3314 = ~I thought you gave up on that when you found out I was a paladin.~
@3315 = ~Whatever floats your boat.~
@3316 = ~"If it's alright with you?" Some evil priest you are.~
@3317 = ~I'm not becoming a Talassan, Dave.~
@3318 = ~No. Leave me be.~
@3319 = ~I know, but I'd still like to give it a try, just for the practice. Maybe you can tell me what you think.~
@3320 = ~Let's see, then. How did I start this off again...?~
@3321 = ~I was raised to be polite! You can't win people over by annoying them, can you?~
@3322 = ~Obviously. I haven't told you why you should yet. Give me a chance.~
@3323 = ~Suppose you were killed by a freak lightning bolt right this second. You'd be furious, wouldn't you? Dying in a completely meaningless way, and nothing to do afterwards but look down on yourself and think about everything you missed out on, everything you never got to finish.~
@3324 = ~I can't say I'd be happy about it, no.~
@3325 = ~And now that thought's going to keep me up at night. Thanks.~
@3326 = ~Not me. I have no regrets.~
@3327 = ~If I were killed by a freak lightning bolt, wouldn't that be Talos' fault?~
@3328 = ~Bear with me then, because this is exactly why you should follow Talos.~
@3329 = ~Hmm. I'm not sure I believe you, but if it's true, you're a rare case. ~
@3330 = ~Probably, but I'm getting to that part.~
@3331 = ~The point is, that could actually happen. You could die to some stupid accident, and it'd be completely out of your control, and that'd be the end of <CHARNAME>'s story. All your plans, all your dreams, cut loose and left to dangle forever.~
@3332 = ~That's why it's so important to live for the moment, to let yourself have what you want. If you always look to the future, where does it leave you if that future is taken away?~
@3333 = ~Decent advice, but I don't see how it relates to worshipping a storm god.~
@3334 = ~And what if it isn't taken away? If you always live for the present, what do you do when the future comes?~
@3335 = ~But you have to take other people's lives into consideration. You can't just run riot across the world.~
@3336 = ~I'm liking the sound of this so far.~
@3337 = ~Anything. Anything you want. What's stopping you?~
@3338 = ~You can, <CHARNAME>. Everyone just tells you you're not supposed to. Maybe it's time to stop listening.~
@3339 = ~If you believe in your own value, if you believe in squeezing every drop out of life before it ends, Talos is the only choice that makes sense. Every other god, even the kind gods, even the "free" gods, expect you to uphold their rules all the time. Don't tell lies, don't turn your back on the needy, don't use magic recklessly, don't do this, don't do that. Your own wishes always comes second.~
@3340 = ~But not Talos. As long as we wear his symbol and teach everyone else to be afraid of him, we can do whatever we like. And in return for the fear we give him, he takes all the other fear away.~
@3341 = ~That's all there is to it. Live without fear, and keep Talos in your prayers, because he decides where and when that freak lightning bolt will land.~
@3342 = ~I don't agree with all of it, but it's interesting, at least.~
@3343 = ~You make a compelling case.~
@3344 = ~That's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard.~
@3345 = ~And you think that justifies the crimes committed under Talos?~
@3346 = ~That's a start, then. The idea is just to get a foot in the door, make them curious. Once they actually see what Talos has to offer, they'll be signing up in droves. (Really need to start expanding the temple, in case it actually works...)~
@3347 = ~Thank you! If more people would just listen, I think our church would be much more widespread than it is. Not that I'm complaining. Sometimes it's nice to be so tight-knit. (Except when it's your turn to bring snacks, *again*.)~
@3348 = ~That's fine. I've never gone over it with anyone outside the church, so I knew it'd need some work. (Maybe don't slag off all the other gods so much. People do get testy about that...)~
@3349 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It's not about justification. You don't *need* to justify anything anymore. That's what makes it so liberating.~
@3350 = ~Did you say something?~
@3351 = ~Not a word.~
@3352 = ~I was talking to someone else.~
@3353 = ~Nothing you were meant to hear.~
@3354 = ~Dave's hearing voices, everyone. Get the shackles.~
@3355 = ~Wait...~ [CAS_P04N]
@3356 = ~Oh! I'm getting a Sending, I think. Just a moment.~
@3357 = ~Hello? Yes, this is Dave.~
@3358 = ~Say again? Sorry, the wind isn't great out here.~ [CAS_P04N]
@3359 = ~Ah, alright. Yes. As soon as I can. I'll see you there.~ [CAS_P04N]
@3360 = ~That was my boss. Apparently I'm needed back at the temple.~
@3361 = ~Why were you just talking to yourself?~
@3362 = ~Needed for what?~
@3363 = ~This isn't the best time for detours, Dave. ~
@3364 = ~I was talking to Stormlord Jeff. Remember I told you about him? He speaks to us through the wind sometimes. Much faster than sending a messenger, although the transmission can be a bit...crackly.~
@3365 = ~He didn't say. The spell only lets you send so many words, and trying to squeeze them all in just confuses people. We learned that the hard way. Poor Todd...~
@3366 = ~I won't ask you to come with me, but if you don't, we might not see each other again. I don't know where I'll be headed afterwards.~
@3367 = ~You're sure they won't mind me being there?~
@3368 = ~Alright, we'll go. Where do we find this temple?~
@3369 = ~Sorry, but you're on your own. If that means parting ways, so be it.~
@3370 = ~With you representing another faith, you mean? Nah. You might catch an earful, but we try not to wage holy war in the temple itself. The clean-up's a nightmare.~
@3371 = ~Of course they won't. We wouldn't have many followers if we barred newcomers, would we? Just try to keep an open mind. And wipe your feet first.~
@3372 = ~You know High Hedge, west of Beregost? There's this huge stone building with eight towers, and doors twice as tall as a man.~
@3373 = ~It's the one next to that.~
@3374 = ~One thing, though. Don't go in without me. If you barge in with all your gear and such, they'll assume the worst.~
@3375 = ~Ah, that's a shame. But fair enough. I'll put in a good word with Talos for you. If you do get killed, at least it won't be in a storm.~
@3376 = ~Ahh, that was fun. I'd listen to Stormlord Jeff for hours, if he could keep it going that long.~
@3377 = ~What do you think? They're good people, right? Good company, I mean.~
@3378 = ~Good company? All that old man did was shout at me!~
@3379 = ~It's not what I was expecting, I'll say that much.~
@3380 = ~Frankly, I couldn't get out of there fast enough.~
@3381 = ~A colourful bunch, yes. I can see why you'd want to join them.~
@3382 = ~That's just how he makes sure you're listening. If he was actually angry with you, he'd have done far worse than shout.~
@3383 = ~What *did* you expect? If you abuse people who want to join you, nobody will join you. Just common sense.~
@3384 = ~Oh, give them a chance. You might have more in common with them than you realise.~
@3385 = ~It's not too late to sign up, <CHARNAME>. I know you're busy with your own things right now, but I'm sure you'd be welcome when you're done.~
@3386 = ~Alan's actually been to Candlekeep, you know. He apprenticed as a scribe with the Oghmanytes as a boy, and they took him there on a field trip. Says it was the most fun he'd ever had before he joined us.~
@3387 = ~And Stormlord Jeff's here all the way from Suzail. Could you tell? He was a Transmuter-Captain in the Cormyrian War Wizards. Personally hasted the vanguard in the war against King Gondegal.~
@3388 = ~Really? No lightning bolts?~
@3389 = ~The one that lasted only eight days and had almost no battles?~
@3390 = ~Who?~
@3391 = ~And now he worships a storm god from a hut. That's quite a transition.~
@3392 = ~This was before he worshipped Talos, remember. Besides, there wasn't much actual fighting going on.~
@3393 = ~I never said it was a point of pride.~
@3394 = ~I should say Usurper King, really. He assembled his own legion by promising loot and land to every mercenary he could find, then took a stab at conquering Cormyr. Even got as far as building himself a throne in Arabel, which is practically the second capital. It fell flat, though. The battle Stormlord Jeff fought in was the last one before Gondegal gave up and fled.~
@3395 = ~It seems mad, doesn't it? From a decorated Cormyrian military veteran to a Talassan priest in the sticks. It's a problem with authority, I reckon. Nothing ever stops him from giving the people in charge a piece of his mind, and I'd guess the War Wizards got fed up with that. Here, though...here you can say whatever you want as long as you can back it up.~
@3396 = ~That's how he became Stormlord, in fact. Just walked right up to the previous Stormlord one day and said he didn't like his attitude. Ended up defeating him in a Trial by Thunder.~
@3397 = ~Is that some kind of ritual?~
@3398 = ~Everything's thunder with you people, isn't it?~
@3399 = ~I don't understand how a church can function, when anyone can just bash their superior on the head and take their title.~
@3400 = ~A Trial by Thunder is a type of duel. You gather all the local clergy together and have them pray for a lightning storm, while the challenger and their opponent stand out in the open.~
@3401 = ~Once the clouds roll in, the duelists have to prove themselves to Talos. Not by swinging maces or casting spells, but by showing their will, their eagerness to serve. That way, when the bolts start raining down, they have nothing to protect them but Talos' favour. Then it's just a question of who falls first.~
@3402 = ~How exactly do you prove yourself?~
@3403 = ~So the winner is decided by chance?~
@3404 = ~That's absolutely insane.~
@3405 = ~That's not true! Sometimes it's hurricanes. Or earthquakes. Or...anyway.~
@3406 = ~Well...I'm not saying that doesn't happen, because it does. But this isn't quite the same thing.~
@3407 = ~That's for you to decide. Having a big list of rules defeats the point. The way you choose to do it is just as important as how well you do it.~
@3408 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. Talos brings the storm. He *is* the storm, and the storm is the only judge. There's no disputing it.~
@3409 = ~Maybe it is. But it made Jeff a Stormlord, and nobody deserved it more than he did. I'm not going to argue with the results.~
@3410 = ~I was there that day, when they had the Trial. It was just after told them I wanted to join. I still remember everyone gathered in the field. Rain bucketing down, but nobody had a drop of water on them. Wind strong enough to fell trees, but everyone stood steady. Lightning flaring overhead, and they just raised their hands like they could've snatched it out of the sky.~
@3411 = ~They all seemed like they'd been doing it forever. And there was me, the fisherman's boy, still with river weed in my shoes, acting like I had any business.~
@3412 = ~Once everyone else had gone, Stormlord Jeff took me into the temple and opened that beat-up trunk in the bedroom, and inside was his old military robe, with the purple dragon insignia and everything. And he said "Never feel constrained by what you used to be." I'll never forget that.~
@3413 = ~I wonder what these Athkatlans are going to be like. It's been ages since we've had anyone new around. Not counting you, of course.~
@3414 = ~Your Stormlord seemed to think they look down on you.~
@3415 = ~I've heard bad things about them myself.~
@3416 = ~You sound excited.~
@3417 = ~I'd prefer you didn't lump me in with your church.~
@3418 = ~Nah. Maybe they do, but I'm not going to assume and neither would he. He was just lighting fires.~
@3419 = ~Obviously. If you haven't heard bad things about a church of Talos, they aren't doing their jobs very well. Or at all.~
@3420 = ~How can I not be? Do you know they don't even hide their temple? It's right there in the heart of the city, just across the street from an order of paladins. How brazen is that? I can't wait to find out how they get away with it.~
@3421 = ~Hey, you're a conspirator at the very least. If I ever do get arrested, you'll be in the next cell over for harbouring me.~
@3422 = ~I just hope they send someone with experience. They said the idea was to "bolster the ranks", but numbers shouldn't be our first priority right now. It's leadership we need.~
@3423 = ~You don't trust Stormlord Jeff?~
@3424 = ~I don't know about that. You seemed pretty sparse to me.~
@3425 = ~How so? Your leader seems to have everything under control.~
@3426 = ~Oh, I do. If it were up to me, he'd be running this ship for a long time to come. But that won't happen.~
@3427 = ~Yes, but more bodies won't amount to much by itself. They need some kind of direction, and if we don't find a new leader soon, there'll be nobody to give it.~
@3428 = ~Stormlord Jeff's getting old, <CHARNAME>. He'll never admit it, but it's true. Every time I see him, he's hunched over by another inch. Every time he gives a sermon, it leaves him a little more winded.~
@3429 = ~He's been a great Stormlord, but we can't count on him forever. Sooner or later, someone will have to take up the reins, and I honestly don't know who it'll be.~
@3430 = ~What about that big lad with the missing tooth? He seemed decent enough.~
@3431 = ~What about that skinny one with the spectacles? He struck me as a thinking man.~
@3432 = ~What about that tall woman with the scars? She looked plenty experienced to me. ~
@3433 = ~What about that older man with the stubble? Maybe he could handle it.~
@3434 = ~What about you? Why not take charge of the place yourself?~
@3435 = ~Why not join the Athkatlan temple instead?~
@3436 = ~Well don't look at me for advice. I'd rather not see Talos thrive, thank you.~
@3437 = ~Brian? He'd soil himself if anyone put him in charge of anything, and he'd be the first to tell you that. Twenty or thirty years from now, he'll still be an acolyte, and perfectly happy about it.~
@3438 = ~How about you, then? Couldn't you run the place?~
@3439 = ~Why not join the Athkatlan temple instead, then?~
@3440 = ~Alan? I don't know. He's one of the smartest people I've met, but...that's just it. He's a bit *too* smart. All academia and philosophy. It always feels like he's more interested in learning things than doing things.~
@3441 = ~Pam? She isn't a priest, and she doesn't want to be. I don't think anything could make her give up that sword. ~
@3442 = ~Phil? He has his wife and children to think about. Being Stormlord would take up too much time, and he'd never be able to keep it a secret. He wouldn't take it.~
@3443 = ~Me?! No chance. Not that I wouldn't do it, but I...I don't think I could. Take my religion out of the picture and I'm just some boy. Nothing exceptional about me.~
@3444 = ~You certainly had no trouble assessing your fellows. That's important for a leader.~
@3445 = ~Perhaps, but you do seem to have given this more thought than anyone else.~
@3446 = ~If you weren't exceptional, I wouldn't be keeping you here.~
@3447 = ~That's true. You're the most average person I've ever seen.~
@3448 = ~Because I like it here. I like the people. I don't need a big church, <CHARNAME>. Only a happy one.~
@3449 = ~Oh, it wouldn't be that bad. Not for you, at least, living the adventuring life. Some township gets consumed in a giant storm, all it means for you is one fewer tavern to sleep in.~
@3450 = ~That just comes from knowing them for a long time. It's not anything special. Is it? I don't think so. Anyone could do it.~
@3451 = ~I just don't want to see us collapse, that's all. That church means a lot to me, and I'll do whatever I can to keep it going.~
@3452 = ~Thank you. I don't see it, though. I really don't. ~
@3453 = ~I know! If I only stand out because I'm a Talassan, and you put me in a room with a load of other Talassans, I might as well be invisible. Who would follow someone like that? ~
@3454 = ~In the end, this visit might be just what we need. As long as they're ready to work with us, instead of against us. Fingers crossed.~
@3455 = ~Sorry about that.~
@3456 = ~Do you want to go right now?~
@3457 = ~Don't tell me you're going to do as he says.~
@3458 = ~If this keeps up, I'll start looking for another cleric.~
@3459 = ~I'd appreciate it. I don't like the cut of his jib, and with Stormlord Jeff gone...~
@3460 = ~I have to. I don't know what he has planned for us, and with Stormlord Jeff gone...~
@3461 = ~I'm sorry. Really. I know it's inconvenient, but I have to go, with or without you. With Stormlord Jeff gone...~
@3462 = ~Those people are my friends. I won't just leave them in the lurch.~
@3463 = ~I'd be glad to accompany you.~
@3464 = ~Ugh. This had better be worth the walk.~
@3465 = ~We'll go, but only because nobody gets away with calling me a cur.~
@3466 = ~I understand. Be on your way, and do what you must.~
@3467 = ~Go, then. Good riddance.~
@3468 = ~Thank you! If only everyone was so keen to visit our temples. We'd rule the world.~
@3469 = ~It means all the more when I know you'd rather not. Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~
@3470 = ~That was sort of rude, wasn't it? *Somebody* wasn't raised right.~
@3471 = ~Wish me luck, <CHARNAME>. I'll do the same for you.~
@3472 = ~Right. That got them motivated.~
@3473 = ~Now I just need to figure out what I'm actually going to do.~
@3474 = ~I'm surprised you want them fighting bandits instead of raiding villages.~
@3475 = ~And you *almost* had me thinking you were competent.~
@3476 = ~Why not just do as he says? Bring him a gift for Talos.~
@3477 = ~Would the Athkatlan temple intervene if you asked?~
@3478 = ~Weren't you just saying you needed a new leader? ~
@3479 = ~Why? If we're going to terrorise anyone, I say we start with the people who want to rob us. Talos isn't picky.~
@3480 = ~Besides, the bandit problem affects everyone. If people see that worshipping Talos gives them the power to fight back, that'll help our numbers. Raiding can wait.~
@3481 = ~They just needed to think someone had things in hand. And I will! Eventually.~
@3482 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is the oldest trick in the book. Your superior asks for a gift, you bring them one, they tell you it's not good enough, then they offer it up themselves and take the credit. It's practically Talassan policy that if you fall for that, you deserve it.~
@3483 = ~What would I say? The new Stormherald's being mean to us? I'd just come back with spit on my face.~
@3484 = ~We do; I mean, now we *really* do; but this isn't it. I could tell right away.~
@3485 = ~I don't know how Taranis managed to get his position...well, actually, I do know. He clobbered his way up. That might build strength, but it doesn't build character, and the proof's in the pudding. Not even a day here and everyone hates him.~
@3486 = ~We have to...to make a point, somehow. None of us are weak. Stormlord Jeff was the greatest Talassan I've ever known. He'd have mopped the floor with Taranis in his prime, I'm sure of it. And he passed so much of himself on to us. We can't be unworthy, learning from someone like that. We can't be.~
@3487 = ~I'll come up with something. Just give me some time.~
@3488 = ~<CHARNAME>. You think we're useful, right?~
@3489 = ~Of course I do.~
@3490 = ~Not if I have to start validating you.~
@3491 = ~Uhhh...~
@3492 = ~And that's the reason you keep us around?~
@3493 = ~I'm not angling. It's an honest question.~
@3494 = ~Us. The people you travel with.~
@3495 = ~If someone didn't have anything to contribute, you wouldn't be adventuring with them, would you? You don't owe them anything. You'd just send them on their way.~
@3496 = ~Not if they were a friend.~
@3497 = ~What brought this on?~
@3498 = ~With a boot up the arse.~
@3499 = ~Really? If I had a friend who couldn't handle danger, I'd want to keep them out of it. ~
@3500 = ~I was just thinking about something Taranis said. "Worthless."~
@3501 = ~Stormlord Jeff was always particular about that word. He'd call you a fool, a wretch, a craven, spineless, toothless, witless, but never worthless.~
@3502 = ~Everyone and everything has potential, he said, whether they're on our side or not. If our enemies are worthless, it means nothing to destroy them.~
@3503 = ~Very mindful for a Talassan.~
@3504 = ~If something's worthless, you dispose of it.~
@3505 = ~That seems fussy. It's just a word.~
@3506 = ~I've heard people end sentences with "for a Talassan" so many times, it's lost all meaning.~
@3507 = ~Do you honestly want to spend your life picking up someone else's litter?~
@3508 = ~Even so. "Worthless." It's the way you say it. "Begone, you worthless dogs!" Like that. It's a word for bellowing. He just said it like it was nothing, which means he really believes it. And if we're worthless, why bother with us?~
@3509 = ~Maybe he wants you to show him you're not worthless.~
@3510 = ~Because he was told to.~
@3511 = ~He probably just likes to feel important.~
@3512 = ~That's not how it works. A leader's supposed to bring out your strengths, not sit back and wait for you to find them.~
@3513 = ~But that's the problem. What kind of Talassan does something just because he was told to? "I'm just following orders" is something Helmites say.~
@3514 = ~Then he should have stayed in Amn. He went from a massive, gilded temple in the capital to a wood cabin outside Beregost, and you think he did it to feel important?~
@3515 = ~He doesn't want to be here. That much is obvious. If I could just use that somehow...~
@3516 = ~Oh, I'm *such an idiot.* How did I not think of this earlier?~
@3517 = ~<CHARNAME>! Remember how Taranis asked for an offering? I need to find one. Something really big.~
@3518 = ~I thought you weren't going along with that?~
@3519 = ~No way. I'm not handing my hard-earned treasures over to that lummox.~
@3520 = ~Like what?~
@3521 = ~I'm not. I've got an idea.~
@3522 = ~We won't have to give it to him, <CHARNAME>. I just need something to show him. Some kind of bait.~
@3523 = ~Just keep an eye out. Any relics or magic items, anything at all that might have something to do with Talos. I just need one thing to bargain with, and then I can fix all of this.~
@3524 = ~<CHARNAME>! That idol...I need to bring it to Taranis as an offering.~
@3525 = ~What, now you want to just do as he says?~
@3526 = ~Suits me. I was getting nervous holding on to it.~
@3527 = ~No way. It's mine.~
@3528 = ~I'm not going to give it to him. I just need to show him. Trust me. This will work...I hope.~
@3529 = ~<CHARNAME>, I meant to say thanks for your help with Taranis. If I didn't have you around, I don't think that would have gone so well.~
@3530 = ~Why's that? You won the trial all by yourself.~
@3531 = ~Taranis would have killed you the moment you challenged him if I hadn't been there.~
@3532 = ~Everything goes better with <CHARNAME>. If you haven't learned that by now, I don't know what to tell you. ~
@3533 = ~You'd *better* thank me. Do you know how long it took me to dry out?~
@3534 = ~If it weren't for that idol, there wouldn't have been a trial, and I'd never have found it on my own. Some of that credit belongs to you.~
@3535 = ~Probably! He is *not* used to being confronted like that. No wonder he ended up killing Stormlord Jeff, really. That man was a rebel from his first breath.~
@3536 = ~I wish you'd join the church. I really do. We'd have a riot together.~
@3537 = ~In my defence, nobody made you stand outside and watch. Come to think of it, you really should have taken cover. Talos doesn't always think aiming is important.~
@3538 = ~The bad news is, I can't stick around with you much longer. As Stormlord, I'll have to be at the temple a lot more, especially with all these new recruits turning up. But for now...seeing as I kept dragging you away from your own adventures, it's only fair I help you see them through.~
@3539 = ~Let your enemies tremble, <CHARNAME>! For I, Stormlord Dave, shall stand alongside you, a conduit for the unyielding fury of Talos! WALK FEARLESS IN THE STORM!~
@3540 = ~Now you say it.~
@3541 = ~Walk fearless in the storm.~
@3542 = ~Maybe I don't actually need you.~
@3543 = ~Thanks. Love the enthusiasm.~
@3544 = ~Spoilsport.~
@3545 = ~It's my first day. Give me a break.~
@3546 = ~<CHARNAME>, that idol...I think it might be worth holding on to it.~
@3547 = ~Why is that?~
@3548 = ~Don't worry. I was planning to.~
@3549 = ~I don't know. It makes me unseasy.~
@3550 = ~It's junk, Dave.~
@3551 = ~Kozah is what Talos used to be called in ancient times. Stormlord Jeff taught us that. Maybe it's my connection to him...I can feel something coming from it. Some kind of energy, hidden deep inside. ~
@3552 = ~I've no idea what to do with it right now, mind you. I'm just letting you know, it might be more useful than it seems. ~
@3553 = ~This is it. This idol is exactly what I need. If Taranis doesn't want to get his hands on this, I'll eat my symbol.~
@3554 = ~You made up your mind awfully quick.~
@3555 = ~I'd like to see that.~
@3556 = ~As long as Taranis can feel it too, this should be perfect. Let's bring it to him, <CHARNAME>. It's time to get my temple back.~
@3557 = ~<CHARNAME>, take another look at the idol. It's practically humming! Looks like all that lightning woke it up.~
@3558 = ~By the way, Thundercat will be joining us. Being in the temple reminds her of Stormlord Jeff too much. Besides, it'll...ow...it'll be good for her to get out for a while and...ow! Thundercat, stop. Stop it. You need to go in my pack, where it's safe...ARGH!~
@3559 = ~She, um. She won't be any trouble. Promise.~
@3560 = ~You know, <CHARNAME>, killing Sarevok won't solve everything immediately. Word needs time to spread. Between the Flaming Fist, the last of Sarevok's fanatics, and any slow-on-the-uptake assassins, you'll probably be hunted for a while yet.~
@3561 = ~If you need somewhere to hole up until things blow over, our temple doors are open.~
@3562 = ~Thank you, Dave. I think I'll take you up on that.~
@3563 = ~I wouldn't have got this far if I hid in the woods and waited for my problems to disappear.~
@3564 = ~Your temple only has the one door.~
@3565 = ~That's nice, but I'm still not going to convert.~
@3566 = ~I should hope so, considering I'm one of you.~
@3567 = ~Just be warned, it might get crowded. Phil's been bombarding me with letters, all in the vein of "There's too many new applicants, I dunno where to put 'em all, we're losing the plot down here, when are you gonna stop skiving off you slippery little buggerface."~
@3568 = ~No, but this time they really will disappear. Or at least they'll drop off to something manageable. Even we know to fight our battles one at a time.~
@3569 = ~For now. Maybe it's time we built a bigger one. Or stole someone else's. Or maybe we'll even take a trip down to Athkatla and show them how it's done.~
@3570 = ~I haven't said a word about that in ages, <CHARNAME>. Are you sure you're not protesting too much? It's alright. Just admit it to yourself. Only the other gods can judge you, and who cares about them?~
@3571 = ~Well, yes. Of course they were open anyway. But now they're especially open. As in, nobody will complain if you just sit at the hearth from dawn to dusk and eat all the scones. For a while, anyway.~
@3572 = ~There's one more thing. Sarevok's plan...whether it would have worked or not, I have no idea. I'm still not convinced this hasn't all been a madman finding an outlet for his bloodthirst. All I know is, if Bhaal really did come back to life, it'd be one more god looking to stick his thieving fingers in Talos' portfolios.~
@3573 = ~We had to cede the oceans to Umberlee. We had to cede strife to Cyric. We're not ceding anything else. Not to Bhaal. He had his chance.~
@3574 = ~Most of the way here, I was just along for the ride. But now I'm in. Well and truly in. And I can promise you I won't back down.~
@3575 = ~I never imagined you would, Dave.~
@3576 = ~How about you handle this for me, then? I'm tired.~
@3577 = ~If you did, I'd kill you myself.~
@3578 = ~You should have. This wasn't my fight for a long time. But thanks for the sentiment, even if I probably don't deserve it.~
@3579 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you really want this story to end with "And then <PRO_HESHE> ran away and let <PRO_HISHER> friend Dave finish the job", I will. But I don't think you do.~
@3580 = ~<CHARNAME>, that's not scary anymore. It really isn't. I'm a Stormlord now, and you should be glad I'm not just helping you out of fear.~
@3581 = ~I speak for Talos, and Talos says we have enough gods already. Sarevok fled here to weather the storm. Let's bring the storm to him.~
@3582 = ~What just happened?!~
@3583 = ~Alright, Talos? That hardly seems fai-~
@3584 = ~You should really give that back now.~
@3585 = ~Rightyessorry.~
@3586 = ~How are you?~
@3587 = ~How do you think we're doing so far?~
@3588 = ~You really don't act much like a Talassan.~
@3589 = ~Where are you from, Dave?~
@3590 = ~Do you think your family would be proud of you serving Talos?~
@3591 = ~How can you support such death and ruin as the Talassans cause?~
@3592 = ~How did you find that temple in the first place? I'd never have known what it was if you hadn't pointed it out.~
@3593 = ~That Kelly girl seems nice.~
@3594 = ~In the future, could you ever see yourself doing anything else?~
@3595 = ~Any plans to settle down? Start a family?~
@3596 = ~If you did have children, would you raise them to worship Talos as well?~
@3597 = ~You don't seem very upset about Stormlord Jeff.~
@3598 = ~What do you think will happen to Taranis now?~
@3599 = ~How does it feel to be the new Stormlord?~
@3600 = ~How's Thundercat?~
@3601 = ~Suppose Talos were to die, as Bhaal did. What would you do then?~
@3602 = ~Dave, Gorion's letter said I'm part of Alaundo's prophecy. I'm one of Bhaal's children.~
@3603 = ~Is there some reason you're lying to Alora?~
@3604 = ~Ajantis will never be your friend, you know.~
@3605 = ~I want to know about that Tyrran priest you met.~
@3606 = ~Not having much luck with Branwen, are you?~
@3607 = ~Is Dorn really the sort of person you want joining your church?~
@3608 = ~If it makes you feel better, I think carrying all of Dynaheir's belongings is broadening your shoulders nicely enough.~
@3609 = ~Are you actually trying to talk Faldorn out of killing people?~
@3610 = ~Of all the people to try and debate with, you choose Jaheira.~
@3611 = ~Imoen is like a sister to me. If anything should happen...~
@3612 = ~How do you feel about Kagain being an Abbathorian?~
@3613 = ~If the Talassans are as diverse as you'd have Khalid think, why is everyone in your church a human?~
@3614 = ~If you want Kivan off your back, I don't think characterising the pain of his lost lover as teenage heartbreak is the way to go.~
@3615 = ~Neera as a Talassan is an interesting prospect.~
@3616 = ~What's all this about Selune creating Talos?~
@3617 = ~So you thought Safana meant to play us for fools, and you didn't think it was worth mentioning to me?~
@3618 = ~How can you terrorise people under Talos one minute and try to help someone like Xan the next?~
@3619 = ~You bought into Flara's dragon story quite readily.~
@3620 = ~I doubt you'll make a Talassan of Littlun any time soon.~
@3621 = ~You and Vynd are getting along well enough.~
@3622 = ~How's that girdle treating you?~
@3623 = ~Want a drink, Dave?~
@3624 = ~Never mind.~
@3625 = ~A bit thirsty. I wouldn't mind something to eat either. And the strap on this pack doesn't sit on my shoulder properly...~
@3626 = ~Oh, you meant "Are you hurt?" Er, no.~
@3627 = ~Just pondering the cleric's eternal dilemma. "Is this bad enough for Cure Light Wounds yet?"~
@3628 = ~Oof. I haven't been this banged up since my consecratory hazing. We lose a lot of initiates that way...~
@3629 = ~If I burn all my best healing spells, I might just fall short of alright.~
@3630 = ~Uh...remind me what we're doing again?~
@3631 = ~Solving the iron crisis.~
@3632 = ~Finding the bandit hideout.~
@3633 = ~Shutting down the Cloakwood base.~
@3634 = ~Stopping the Iron Throne.~
@3635 = ~Stopping Sarevok.~
@3636 = ~I'm glad to see you're so invested.~
@3637 = ~Oh! That's right. I'll remember this time.~
@3638 = ~I am! It's hard to keep track of all this stuff without a journal, though. Half the time I'm just nodding my head and throwing the lightning. But half the time that's all you need me to do, so it works out. ~
@3639 = ~<CHARNAME>, you shouldn't even have to ask. Nothing can stop us with the winds of Talos at our backs!~
@3640 = ~Oh, nowhere worth talking about. Little fishing village where nobody knew anybody except the other villagers. You grew up in Candlekeep, so you probably know what that feels like. Same day every day, that creeping sensation of confinement...~
@3641 = ~I loved Candlekeep. I'd move back if I could.~
@3642 = ~You don't miss it, then.~
@3643 = ~Finally, someone who understands! I'm so glad Gorion took me out of there.~
@3644 = ~Really.~
@3645 = ~That baffles me. I can understand wanting to visit now and then, but to make it your home? Close the doors to the world again? There's so much to see out here, <CHARNAME>. Why hide it from yourself?~
@3646 = ~When I'm out on the road, cold and tired, and the only towns nearby are the ones I've already been chased out of, I do catch myself wishing I was back in that little fishing village. That doesn't mean much, though. If you only miss home when times are tough, you don't really miss it at all.~
@3647 = ~Exactly. There's nothing for me there. Not anymore. Sometimes I want to go back and destroy the place just to make it final, but I don't know. I feel like that'd be petty of me. That and my mum would never let me hear the end of it.~
@3648 = ~Don't I?~
@3649 = ~Kneel, maggot! When the lightning falls, those who stand tall are first to be struck! Kneel and beg the storm god's clemency!~
@3650 = ~Oh no! Please! Spare me, mighty Talos! Aaahhh!~
@3651 = ~Oh no. Please. Spare me, mighty Talos. Aaahhh.~
@3652 = ~Thank you. It's harder than you'd think.~
@3653 = ~Wow. I must be better at that than I thought.~
@3654 = ~Ahem. As an ordained priest, I have to ask you not to sass my deity.~
@3655 = ~Easy now! It's just a demonstration! I'm not really asking you to kneel. Or beg. Unless you want to. ~
@3656 = ~But do you know how exhausting it'd be to get on like that all day, every day? Imagine dinnertime. "The tempest comes to ravage everything you cherish! You may slow its relentless advance by passing me the salt!"~
@3657 = ~So you're saying it's just an act?~
@3658 = ~I'd love to do that at dinner.~
@3659 = ~I understand. Save the bombast for the sermons.~
@3660 = ~Not an act, exactly. Every god has a nose for false worship, so you have to mean it at least a little bit.~
@3661 = ~It's just, when you're preaching, you don't talk the same way as when you're not. Same way you don't talk to your friends the way you talk to a stranger. That's not an act. It's just what you do.~
@3662 = ~The first time, yes. The tenth or twentieth, not so much. I'm not going to say I'm speaking from experience there, but...trust me.~
@3663 = ~That's exactly it. Especially for a god like Talos. Nobody comes to us looking for quiet contemplation.~
@3664 = ~Although it'd be funny if someone did.~
@3665 = ~That's an interesting question. Are you asking in good faith, or are you working up to play the guilt card?~
@3666 = ~No, I just want to hear your thoughts.~
@3667 = ~They'd be ashamed of you, Dave.~
@3668 = ~How do you know? Have you met? Probably not, or you wouldn't be saying "they."~
@3669 = ~My mum would disapprove, but my mum disapproving is like the sun rising. It happens daily, you can't stop it and there's no point trying.~
@3670 = ~I could tell her I was taking the Ilmatari cloth, giving away all my possessions and dedicating my life to easing the world's suffering, and she'd have *exactly* the same response as if I'd said I was becoming a Talassan. "What do you wanna do that for? Where do you get these daft ideas from? Why can't you just stay at home and help your mother with the fish?"~
@3671 = ~She's still my mum, and I can't not love my mum. But if I ever have to gut another salmon, I'll throw myself into the lake it came from.~
@3672 = ~Is there some reason I shouldn't?~
@3673 = ~Don't answer right away. Just think about it. Why is it wrong to kill people? If a good person dies, they'll have a good afterlife. Far better than what's down here. If an evil person dies...well. Wouldn't most people say they deserved it?~
@3674 = ~What about those they leave behind? If a working man dies, what of the family that depends on him?~
@3675 = ~An evil person can still redeem themselves. Murdering them takes that chance away.~
@3676 = ~A good person shouldn't suffer the trauma of a violent death.~
@3677 = ~The afterlife itself is proof. We would not be punished for murder if it was just.~
@3678 = ~I don't believe in an afterlife.~
@3679 = ~Ah, well. You could say that's a reason not to kill the man. Or you could say it's a reason to kill the family too.~
@3680 = ~No, *death* takes that chance away. Not just murder. Someone could be thinking about changing their ways, then get flattened by a runaway horse cart. Is that fair? If it's not, that's for the gods to fix, not us.~
@3681 = ~So let's say I knew a spell that could kill someone instantly, without any pain. You're saying it'd be fine to go around casting that on everyone?~
@3682 = ~Yes. That would be acceptable.~
@3683 = ~That's not what I meant.~
@3684 = ~But that presumes a certain type of self-interest. What if someone doesn't mind being punished? What if they enjoy what most people would think of as suffering?~
@3685 = ~This conversation's over then. Sorry, but I might as well try to discuss a book with someone who doesn't believe in words.~
@3686 = ~Let me ask you this, though. Suppose you meet a murderer, and you spend an entire day with him laying out all your sensible arguments for why killing is wrong. And when you're done, he tells you he agrees with your logic, and you're completely right, but it doesn't matter, and he's not going to stop. What do you do then?~
@3687 = ~For the good of all, I would have to strike him down.~
@3688 = ~I don't know.~
@3689 = ~I'd keep trying to persuade him.~
@3690 = ~Are you telling me that's how you feel?~
@3691 = ~...hmm. Not a perspective I've heard before. I'll have to think about that.~
@3692 = ~Then there must be more to it than that.~
@3693 = ~He's already persuaded, <CHARNAME>. He's admitted it. He just likes it too much to care.~
@3694 = ~Oh, I couldn't say. Nobody's managed to convince me yet. But if it was, what would you do?~
@3695 = ~Reasoning is fun, I know. But it only has as much power as we let it have. Quite a flimsy thing to live by, isn't it?~
@3696 = ~That's usually for the best. We wouldn't get much done if we spent all our time at home, fighting off self-proclaimed heroes looking for easy fame. No offence.~
@3697 = ~To be honest, I had no idea myself. I'd heard rumours there was a temple out there, so I went looking for it, but it never even occurred to me to check that cabin. I just walked right past it.~
@3698 = ~I searched those woods until my feet throbbed. And just when I was ready to give up, this massive downpour came thundering down out of nowhere, and I ran back to take shelter in the first place I could. And there everyone was.~
@3699 = ~You'd say it was providence, then?~
@3700 = ~So if that downpour hadn't happened, do you think you wouldn't be a Talassan now?~
@3701 = ~What did they do?~
@3702 = ~Maybe, but I'm not going to act like I'm Talos' chosen champion or something. I think he just got tired of watching me fumble.~
@3703 = ~Nah. I'd just have come back tomorrow.~
@3704 = ~They laughed. Then I said I wanted to join, and they laughed harder. But *then* they got me a seat by the fire and let me listen to a sermon. When I next walked out the door, it was with my symbol.~
@3705 = ~You like her? Don't get your hopes up, because you've got no more chance than I do. Kelly's a ladies' lady.~
@3706 = ~You like her? You'd have more of a chance than I would, <CHARNAME>. Kelly's a ladies' lady.~
@3707 = ~I found that one out the hard way. Still, I suppose if you have to get rejected, there are far worse reasons than that.~
@3708 = ~Like because you serve a crazed, malevolent destroyer god?~
@3709 = ~Maybe she just said that to spare your feelings.~
@3710 = ~Ahh. Nothing quite like that impotent feeling of liking a pretty girl who also likes pretty girls.~
@3711 = ~Tell her I said hello.~
@3712 = ~No, that's a fairly valid reason. I wish it *wasn't*, but it is.~
@3713 = ~As much as I believe Kelly would do that, no. I've seen the way she looks at Pam sometimes. She likes the mature, rugged types...which is probably another reason I got turned down, actually.~
@3714 = ~I know. The struggles we men face.~
@3715 = ~<CHARNAME>...tell her yourself. We're teaching her to be assertive here. I'm not going to enable her by playing love courier.~
@3716 = ~That's a question with a lot of answers.~
@3717 = ~If you're asking why I follow him now, it's because I enjoy it. I've made more friends in the church than anywhere else, and I can't even describe the thrill of holding a storm in your hands.~
@3718 = ~If you're asking why I chose to become a priest, it's because I know myself well enough to know I'd never be happy with a "simple" life. If there's one thing I hate, really hate, it's routine.~
@3719 = ~If you're asking why I chose him and not some other god...I don't know. Sometimes I wonder, the day I made up my mind, what it would have taken to push me in another direction. It was storming, I remember that. If it'd been snowing, maybe today I'd be an Aurilite. But if I had to guess, and I do, I'd say you're asking what gave me the idea in the first place.~
@3720 = ~I wish I had something exciting to tell you. I just felt like it. That's all.~
@3721 = ~Start a family, yes. Settle down, no. The problem is, it's hard to do the first without the second.~
@3722 = ~And it's going to be even harder finding someone to start it with. Phil manages to keep Talos and family separate, but I don't want to have to do that. I need someone I can share everything with.~
@3723 = ~Best get used to being a bachelor, then.~
@3724 = ~Everyone keeps secrets from their partner sometimes.~
@3725 = ~I never took you for a romantic.~
@3726 = ~There's no place for defeatists in the church, <CHARNAME>. Maybe I'll visit the temple of Umberlee. Lots of women in that priesthood, from what I've seen. Just as long as I don't have to get baptised. I hear they have a bad habit of holding you under too long.~
@3727 = ~There's a difference between keeping secrets and pretending to be someone else entirely.~
@3728 = ~Sure. I can just see us now, laughing and holding hands in the rain, watching the screaming masses flee for their lives...~
@3729 = ~I'd raise them to understand that they can do whatever they've set their hearts on. If that means taking after me, great, but I'm not going to press it. Then I'd be turning into my mum.~
@3730 = ~But what if they became paladins or something like that? What if you had to fight them someday?~
@3731 = ~We all turn into our parents sooner or later. Accept the inevitable.~
@3732 = ~Wouldn't that make Talos angry?~
@3733 = ~Someone's most likely going to kill me sooner or later, <CHARNAME>. Talassans don't die in bed. If I live long enough for my children to try bringing me down, I'll be satisfied, and if they manage to do it, I'll be proud.~
@3734 = ~I will not. I reject my fate. If I ever start asking my kids why they can't be more like their father, may Talos strike me dead. Or...maybe just hard enough to remind me I said this.~
@3735 = ~<CHARNAME>, as a Bhaalspawn, are you sure you want to be saying that?~
@3736 = ~I'll cross that bridge if I ever come to it. Maybe once they're old enough, I'll mention that daddy might die horribly if they don't at least say a prayer now and then.~
@3737 = ~I don't think that question applies to me. I more or less do what I want, and why would anyone want to stop doing that?~
@3738 = ~Or were you talking about renouncing my priesthood? I'd be fried to charcoal before I even got the symbol off my neck, so...probably not.~
@3739 = ~Should I be? He's with Talos now, in Fury's Heart, and he wouldn't have it any other way. All he'd want to know is that our church carries on, which it will, and that Thundercat's well looked after, which she is.~
@3740 = ~Besides, we're keeping the remains preserved. If he ever fancies another go at life, one of us will be able to manage it someday.~
@3741 = ~Hard to say. If the Athkatlan temple put out someone like him, chances are they're not as relaxed as us. He might have to face an actual punishment, instead of just being teased about it. Then again, he takes himself so seriously, I think he might prefer it that way.~
@3742 = ~A demotion would do him good. Less responsibilities, less to think about for a while. Time to appreciate the smaller things in life, like how satisfying the explosion is when lightning strikes a wood cottage. ~
@3743 = ~Not much different, but then I haven't really started yet.~
@3744 = ~It's going to be strange, though. People I've spent so long on even terms with, suddenly looking to me for guidance. Phil and Pam are both twice my age! How am I supposed to give them orders and not feel cheeky about it?~
@3745 = ~That's a good thing. It'll keep you grounded, stop you from getting too full of yourself.~
@3746 = ~I'm younger than most people in my party, but it doesn't stop me.~
@3747 = ~You'll happily indulge in random acts of destruction, ruining lives and livelihoods, but you won't boss old people around because you'd "feel cheeky"?~
@3748 = ~Maybe, but what's the point of being Stormlord if you can't go a bit mad with power? In fact, I think going mad with power is a qualification.~
@3749 = ~Yes, but you can get away with anything, can't you? Asking strangers about their past, barging into people's homes to see if they need anything done...if I tried even half the things you do, I'd get a slap in the face and a boot out the door.~
@3750 = ~...fair enough.~
@3751 = ~Still raw over Stormlord Jeff, I think. I've never seen her this moody. And she keeps scratching up my greaves, which she always did, but now it's actually leaving marks.~
@3752 = ~She's tough, though. She'll survive.~
@3753 = ~<CHARNAME>, if this whole experience has taught you anything, it should be that gods don't really die. They change, they hide, they fall silent, but they're never gone forever. As long as someone still believes, there'll always be a piece of them left, clinging to the universe. And I'd believe. To my last breath, I'd believe.~
@3754 = ~Even if he stopped giving you power?~
@3755 = ~I didn't realise you valued loyalty so much.~
@3756 = ~If I find out about a Talosspawn conspiracy, I'm going to be deeply upset.~
@3757 = ~If you still think I do this just for the spells, you really haven't been paying attention.~
@3758 = ~Loyalty might not be the right word. I'd just love to be able to say I played a part in reviving Talos. That's a story for the grandchildren if ever I've heard one. And if I did stop worshipping and he came back anyway...oof. That'd be egg on my face.~
@3759 = ~Is that because you don't want to go through it all again, or because you don't want to play second fiddle? Could be a nice change of pace. You never know.~
@3760 = ~Yeah, I thought as much.~
@3761 = ~"The Lord of Murder shall perish, blah blah, score of mortal progeny." That one? Talos wasn't the first god I read about, you know. I can tell you most anything you'd care to hear about, say, Cyric. Or Umberlee.~
@3762 = ~Or Bhaal.~
@3763 = ~You've only ever mentioned a *foster* father, every day you wake up with more and more magical powers that you can't explain, and someone tried to have you killed before you were ever in a position to make enemies. One evening, by the campfire, I put all those things together with what I know, and I thought "Oh. <CHARNAME>'s a Bhaalspawn."~
@3764 = ~And at no point did you see fit to SAY SOMETHING?~
@3765 = ~I'm glad you're taking it so well.~
@3766 = ~That's an absurd conclusion to reach!~
@3767 = ~That was your reaction? Just "Oh"? I'm a monster!~
@3768 = ~It's not the easiest topic to broach, is it? "<CHARNAME>, call me insane, but I think your absentee father is actually the ex-god of murder, using you as a vessel to claw his way back into the pantheon." I figured you'd find out some other way or that it wouldn't end up mattering. Either way, you're not making plans to have me committed.~
@3769 = ~Are you joking? It's half the reason I'm still here! I can't wait to see how all this plays out.~
@3770 = ~Is it? The way I see it, a conclusion can be either stupid or true, but not both.~
@3771 = ~Do you honestly think I'd be what I am if I was scared of monsters?~
@3772 = ~Thanks for, uh, telling me though. I appreciate what you *tried* to do there.~
@3773 = ~Oh, no thanks. I promised my mum I wouldn't drink until I could grow a full beard.~
@3774 = ~I think I'm getting there.~
@3775 = ~You know, this wouldn't be so bad if you could take it off without having to break the curse every time. City guards out in force, chasing rumours of a Talassan agent..."Oh, beg your pardon miss. It's a man we're after. Carry on."~
@3776 = ~Because of our faiths, or because he's too stiff? If it's the second one, you might be right. Otherwise, don't be so sure. I used to be on good terms with a man from Tyr's priesthood.~
@3777 = ~How is that possible? Talos and Tyr are enemies!~
@3778 = ~And he knew you were a Talassan?~
@3779 = ~"Used to be"?~
@3780 = ~But *we* weren't. Not at the time, anyway.~
@3781 = ~Oh yes. Right from the start. And I knew he was a Tyrran.~
@3782 = ~You can probably guess how it ended. But I wouldn't take it back, even so.~
@3783 = ~I just happened to sit next to him in a tavern one evening. When I went to reach for my coinpurse, he spotted the holy symbol poking out of my tunic. And he didn't need to hide his, so... ~
@3784 = ~Any other day, it probably would have meant a fight, but we'd both been travelling. We were tired, out of magic, and this particular tavern made you leave your weapons at the door. We'd just have been punching each other in the face until the bouncers threw us out.~
@3785 = ~So he took his drink and started muttering all this abuse. "Talassan filth, Tyr's justice will find you one day," blah blah blah. Then I made a joke, and it must have caught him off guard. He nearly choked trying not to laugh, ended up spraying his brandy everywhere.~
@3786 = ~I bought him another one just to see if he'd take it, and...he did. Then he decided he didn't want to owe me a favour, so he paid for my dinner. And that was that. Friends, or something like it. For a little while, we looked past the symbols at the person wearing them.~
@3787 = ~He died trying to raid our temple. When he saw me, he, uh...he hesitated, and that gave me the chance. Not my proudest moment, but he'd have done the same. Probably.~
@3788 = ~I can't disappoint that face! I may be a Talassan, but I'm not a monster.~
@3789 = ~Besides, she asked me if I *do* destroy villages, not if I *have* destroyed them. And I'm not doing it. Not since I joined you. So technically that isn't lying, right?~
@3790 = ~Yes. Yes it is.~
@3791 = ~Oh, whatever. I don't know why I'm looking for loopholes. I'm not a Gargauthan.~
@3792 = ~Oh, I don't know. Considering who she worships, if she really didn't like me, I think she'd do worse than tell me off.~
@3793 = ~Even so, I don't think theological discussion is going to get you anywhere.~
@3794 = ~She probably just doesn't think you'd put up a good fight.~
@3795 = ~You're right. Beneath all the icy glares, I'm sure she's practically smouldering with desire.~
@3796 = ~My other options are a wrestling match or a drinking contest. I think I'll stick to the one I have a chance of winning.~
@3797 = ~That's not...necessarily...~
@3798 = ~Listen, my mum taught me not to hit women. And I'm not saying she was right or wrong, but I still hold her in some regard and I try to abide by her. Where possible.~
@3799 = ~*sigh* I just like golden hair, <CHARNAME>. A lot. What can I say?~
@3800 = ~I see your point. He's not much fun, is he?~
@3801 = ~That's putting it mildly.~
@3802 = ~I don't think either Talos or his patron would approve of him serving two masters.~
@3803 = ~I meant because he's a black-hearted fiend with no redeeming qualities.~
@3804 = ~Then again, maybe nobody's shown him a good time yet. Who knows? A good Talassan revel, a few dozen ales...he might let himself go. Which could end really badly, now that I think about it.~
@3805 = ~Alright, I didn't think it through. I admit it.~
@3806 = ~Oh, that. Pfft. It wouldn't be a contest, <CHARNAME>. Talos is a *god*. He has far more power than some...some demon.~
@3807 = ~Sorry, I just realised this sounds a lot like "My dad could beat up his dad." I'll shut up.~
@3808 = ~Um. Are you sure you're not confusing us with some other faith?~
@3809 = ~It...~
@3810 = ~It does.~
@3811 = ~No. Not at all. I'm just trying to understand why she thinks she should. There is no god of nature, in any pantheon, who says "Destroy anyone who might have accidentally stepped on a flower." I'm sure of it.~
@3812 = ~And that means someone came up with it. Someone watched a man tread on a dandelion and thought "He must die." And I'd love to meet that person, because I'm sure they're very interesting.~
@3813 = ~Nothing's going to happen!~
@3814 = ~Literally nothing, most likely. I get the feeling she's not interested. But if anything does "happen", nothing's going to *happen*. I would never hurt her.~
@3815 = ~Not in the sense you're talking about, at least. I might end up having to kill her some day because of religious obligations or something, but that could just as easily apply to any of you. I'm going to stop talking now because this is not helping my case.~
@3816 = ~She's a tough nut to crack, for sure. Half-elf? The other half must be dwarf, with that kind of stubbornness.~
@3817 = ~She'll give in sooner or later, though. Or she'll hit me a wallop with that stick, but I'd still take it as a concession.~
@3818 = ~I've never been less surprised about anything.~
@3819 = ~I don't know why he's so cagey about it, though. As far as evil gods go, Abbathor isn't so bad. "Get rich by any means necessary." Plenty of merchants follow that creed without having to worship anyone.~
@3820 = ~I didn't exactly say we were diverse. Just that we wouldn't mind *being* diverse. I'd love to bring some other races into the fold, but they aren't interested.~
@3821 = ~It's risk assessment, I think. Your life expectancy under Talos isn't great, but when a human dies young, they lose forty, maybe fifty years. When an elf or a dwarf dies young...that's a lot of life to miss out on.~
@3822 = ~Actually, there's a thought. Some races are shorter-lived than humans are. Maybe we need to start appealing to the hobgoblin crowd...~
@3823 = ~It's true. Bad things happen every day. Terrible things, and they hurt. It's fine to let them hurt. It's not fine to let them darken your days forever.~
@3824 = ~What about you? Your foster father was murdered, wasn't he? What are you going to do after avenging him? Sit down and cry about your loss for the rest of your life, or dust yourself off and move on?~
@3825 = ~Don't you dare talk to me about Gorion.~
@3826 = ~I don't know. So far I haven't had time to cry about it. Once I start, I may not want to stop.~
@3827 = ~Moving on isn't such an easy thing, Dave.~
@3828 = ~That's a poor comparison. Gorion didn't mean much to me.~
@3829 = ~Be angry, <CHARNAME>. Be as angry as you want. Just make something of it. That's all I'm saying.~
@3830 = ~Don't give yourself time, then. Keep busy. Do something. If the alternative is crumpling up in despair, do anything.~
@3831 = ~Most things worth doing aren't easy. If you back down for an easy life, you get run over by everyone who didn't.~
@3832 = ~Maybe, but that answer alone tells me if it ever came down to it, you'd do the latter.~
@3833 = ~I want it. I want it so much. The stories we'd have with someone like her in the ranks...~
@3834 = ~I just need to help her adjust her mindset. To begin with, instead of panicking and apologising when her spells end in catastrophe, she needs to start laughing maniacally. She won't mean it at first, but once it becomes habit...~
@3835 = ~Oh, it's an old creation story. Today there are dozens and dozens of gods, but supposedly, all the way back at the dawn of time, there were only two. Selune and Shar. Light and dark. Those were the only things that existed before Toril.~
@3836 = ~But soon, Selune decided there should be more than that. She wanted a living world that could grow and change, while Shar preferred to hold on to the raw, empty darkness. So they fought. Hard. So hard they tore pieces of their essence from each other, and those pieces reshaped themselves into the gods we know now. And one of them was Talos.~
@3837 = ~Nobody knows for sure. It's impossible to say what the gods were up to before mortals even came about. But if anyone would want to deny that Talos came from Selune, it's the Selunites themselves, and they're all keeping their peace. Seems compelling to me.~
@3838 = ~You mean you *didn't* think that? I just assumed you'd be keeping an eye out for it.~
@3839 = ~It didn't happen anyway, so if I had said anything, I'd be eating it now. And let's be honest, if you're turning down prospective travelling companions based on early misgivings, what's the Talassan priest doing here?~
@3840 = ~Or the blackguard.~
@3841 = ~Or the drow.~
@3842 = ~Or the fugitive wild mage.~
@3843 = ~Or the Cyricist megalomaniac.~
@3844 = ~Or the insane necromancer.~
@3845 = ~Terrorising people means instilling terror, not whatever it is Xan's got.~
@3846 = ~There are gods of sadness, yes. Gods of pain. Fear. Rage. Almost any emotion you can think of, there's a god to represent it, because those are the emotions we need. But this feeling he has, of being hollow and useless...there's no god for that, because it's no use to anybody, and I don't want to see it anymore.~
@3847 = ~I want it to be true! Don't you? Wouldn't it be brilliant if we could say we're travelling with a dragon?~
@3848 = ~Besides, you know how sulky she gets when you argue, and there's no prize for changing her mind. Might as well go along with it, keep her happy. Or...not firespittingly angry, at least.~
@3849 = ~I know, I know. Sometimes I like to try the hopeless cases anyway, just to see how they react.~
@3850 = ~She shot me down quick, but she didn't kick up a stink like lots of people do. And she also didn't try to turn it around on me and have me renounce Talos. I think we'll be just fine.~
@3851 = ~From what I can tell, there are three things that set him off. Being too full of yourself, being a moral crusader, and being stupid. I'm none of those things...I hope...so he saves the venom for other people.~
@3852 = ~Also, not being a woman helps. It helps a *lot*. Definitely some lingering resentment there.~
@3853 = ~What's the matter? Too much lightning? Not enough?~
@3854 = ~I just don't need you at the moment. Head somewhere safe and I'll meet you there.~
@3855 = ~I need you to wait here for now.~
@3856 = ~Just right, actually. Forget I said anything.~
@3857 = ~Friendly Arm it is, then. Possibly the only place on the coast where someone could start a fight with me and *they'd* get kicked out.~
@3858 = ~This isn't a sneaky way of abandoning me, is it? You can just say so. I'm used to it.~
@3859 = ~You DARE dismiss the Stormlord?!~
@3860 = ~...wait, really? I thought we were doing well for ourselves.~
@3861 = ~I'll meet you back at the Friendly Arm.~
@3862 = ~We are. Come back, Stormlord. I didn't mean it.~
@3863 = ~Ready to go? I can only get away with quiet prayer for so long, you know.~
@3864 = ~Ready when you are.~
@3865 = ~Pray for patience, then. I still don't need you yet.~
@3866 = ~I am not interested in your excuses!~
@3867 = ~Ma'am, please, it wasn't me who named the place...~
@3868 = ~Then you've even less reason to cling to it!~
@3869 = ~It's just, the cost of a new sign 'n everything...~
@3870 = ~There is a temple of Helm in this town, is there not? Would you expect them to tolerate the "Watcher's Flatulence" tavern? It's utterly disrespectful! I've half a mind to burn the place for the insult, and the other half for irony's sake!~
@3871 = ~Please <PRO_SIRMAAM>, can you do something? I think she means it.~
@3872 = ~What's the problem here?~
@3873 = ~This sounds like none of my business.~
@3874 = ~Why me? Get your bouncers to take care of it.~
@3875 = ~I'll tell you exactly what the problem is. This squalid excuse for a tavern invokes the most magnificent beings in Faerun for a catchy appellation! A silly joke! "Belching Dragon" indeed.~
@3876 = ~And then they've the nerve to say it's too much trouble to change. Not as much trouble as keeping it, I assure you of that. This fat cretin is one breath away from pork crackling.~
@3877 = ~It's just a name. There's no need for violence.~
@3878 = ~Why do you care if it's named after a dragon?~
@3879 = ~Any flames outside the fireplace and I run you through.~
@3880 = ~I'll leave you to it, then.~
@3881 = ~Quite right. There is another tavern northwest whose destruction is less imminent. Go there.~
@3882 = ~Oh <PRO_SIRMAAM>, if only it was so simple! But, mad as it sounds, this woman's an honest-to-Helm firebreathing sorceress, and APPARENTLY they ain't paid enough to deal with that! See if they get paid at all after today...~
@3883 = ~Fine. What's the problem?~
@3884 = ~Very unfortunate for you, but I'm still not getting involved.~
@3885 = ~If it's just a name then it's just as easily another name! Scorch off a few letters and it becomes the Belch On Tavern. Far more apt, from what little I've seen of it.~
@3886 = ~Because I am one, idiot. I'll not have my species appropriated by some wretched human and his ale pit.~
@3887 = ~Hmph. I'd ask if you know whom you address, but your threats prove you don't.~
@3888 = ~Listen, um...mighty dragoness. I beg you, take pity on this humble barkeep. With the iron crisis an' all, I've just not got the gold to change that horrible sign. Maybe once it's sorted out...~
@3889 = ~The iron crisis?~
@3890 = ~Yes. Uh, yes, your greatness. Bandits on the rise, hardly anyone dares to travel, and them that's meant to keep the peace can't even trust their own swords anymore. I don't want to offend you, your greatness, heavens forbid I offend such a wise and powerful being, but I ain't got two coppers to rub together on account of the crisis, you see?~
@3891 = ~Hmm. Perhaps my stature does skew my perspective. A dragon's trifle is a lesser creature's trial.~
@3892 = ~Very well. If that is your impediment, I shall resolve this iron crisis and restore business to your tavern. And when I return, I do not expect to see that sign again. Is that clear?~
@3893 = ~Yes, ma'am. Perfectly.~
@3894 = ~Good. I depart for the mines forthwith.~
@3895 = ~And you will accompany me.~
@3896 = ~Fine. I was on my way there anyway.~
@3897 = ~As you command, great one.~
@3898 = ~I'll handle it myself, thanks.~
@3899 = ~Go suck your tail, "dragon."~
@3900 = ~I've neither the time nor the patience to deal with every brigand who crosses my path. Equipped as you are, you should serve well enough as a retinue.~
@3901 = ~Then praise the gods that your path is mine.~
@3902 = ~Maintain that deference. I shall remember it when I am whole again.~
@3903 = ~Oh? Better still that I needn't sully myself, then. I shall monitor this place until you return.~
@3904 = ~Er, are you sure you don't want to take her with you? Please?~
@3905 = ~I commit your face and your insult to memory. Pray this region never sees iron again, for when it does, you are my next concern.~
@3906 = ~You again? Have you nothing better to do?~
@3907 = ~Apparently not. What's your problem with this place?~
@3908 = ~Yes I do. So I'll be on my way.~
@3909 = ~So you need my assistance after all. Don't bother making excuses. I didn't expect much to begin with.~
@3910 = ~My apologies. I should have known better than to go without you.~
@3911 = ~Just fall in line. I haven't got all day.~
@3912 = ~Actually, I just wanted to pop in, see if the place was still standing.~
@3913 = ~Yes, yes. I suppose I can overlook it this once. You all make mistakes.~
@3914 = ~Nor have I, but you were quite content to waste *my* time.~
@3915 = ~When my patience does expire, you will not have to "pop in" to see the aftermath. Quicken your pace.~
@3916 = ~Halfling, I can *smell* how cheap that stone is. Do not ever dare offer me glass and call it diamond.~
@3917 = ~You're mistaken, madam. On my honour, what I have here is a gem of true seeing, and it has the power to-~
@3918 = ~It is a chip of rock. Though I would still deem it of greater worth than your honour. Find another mark. Someone more naive, and less inclined towards merciless retribution.~
@3919 = ~W-well, since you put it that way...~
@3920 = ~Those jewels...the man has an eye for quality, I will grant him that.~
@3921 = ~This shambler is no threat. Put it back in its coffin and keep what's ours.~
@3922 = ~And now we dash to the rescue of cattle. What heroics. Such gainful endeavours.~
@3923 = ~Wealth does not make one's downfall, fool. Only lacking the means to guard it.~
@3924 = ~IKE2~ ~I will not be heckled, madam, and nor will there be a refund if I must remove you for disrupting the tour. Now, to continue...~
@3925 = ~Give me my money back, then!~
@3926 = ~An odd thing to admit before a battle. By all means, allow us to capitalise!~
@3927 = ~What is this, some dumping ground for cursed wares? The entire place reeks of malediction! Do not touch anything. And do NOT buy anything.~
@3928 = ~Careful, <CHARNAME>. These elixirs indeed fume with magic, but not all of it benign. I know a drawback when I smell one.~
@3929 = ~MYSMER~ ~What say you, friend? A mere pittance for a taste of godly power and wisdom?~
@3930 = ~I would drive you extinct for naught more than the rasping shriek of your voices! My eardrums shall have their due!~
@3931 = ~She said nothing of returning, only finding. To keep them for ourselves is thus wholly justified, and I'll not hear a word to the contrary.~
@3932 = ~45 gold pieces. Shall I tell you of their actual worth, <CHARNAME>, or merely strike you across the face? Either will hurt.~
@3933 = ~*Infravision*? Does anyone in this group not already possess that faculty?~
@3934 = ~I don't. Can I have them?~
@3935 = ~A scheme I'm well familiar with. If you wish to see it done properly, feel free to observe me from whatever afterlife awaits you.~
@3936 = ~I would not concede this place's *latrines* to you, upstart.~
@3937 = ~None half as stupid as mocking me at the first opportunity.~
@3938 = ~Absolute idiocy, <CHARNAME>. If you must squander life-saving scrolls on strangers, at least see that they are wealthy ones.~
@3939 = ~And what now? Are we to de-petrify every statue in these woods, or did you merely like the looks of this one?~
@3940 = ~There are still basilisks about, <CHARNAME>. Do not waste our countermeasures.~
@3941 = ~Ironic. I'd have spared you no second glance had you not slipped in that threat.~
@3942 = ~Of all those here who could offer allegiance, it had to be this one. If we actually do take him home with us, I shall be most aggrieved.~
@3943 = ~My wealth could amount to a copper coin, and still I would gut you to keep it! Stand down or burn down!~
@3944 = ~How precious. Let fly your cantrips, little wizard, and I will show you a thing or two of "magic skills."~
@3945 = ~You hunt prey, but have found a predator. Turn your eyes to smaller game, or I will teach you your place in the food chain.~
@3946 = ~ZARGAL~ ~Huh? Stupid woman! Zargal want gold, not food!~
@3947 = ~..."slow-witted city folk."~
@3948 = ~There was a time, once, when I would have met this man, and I would have stepped on him, and that would have been the sum of our acquaintance. How dark the days have become.~
@3949 = ~ARCAND~ ~There's darker yet in store for you, as surely as I wertle-woo...~
@3950 = ~Better yet, neither. Though I'll gladly help myself to yours.~
@3951 = ~This shall be a brief affair, then. Cluster them as tightly as you can; it's a great deal more satisfying.~
@3952 = ~I can fathom few fates more grim than to linger powerless after death, watching one's trove picked apart by vultures. Let us grant this creature some respite.~
@3953 = ~The myriad of lost pearls buried in the earth, and you choose to excavate the home of some backwater medicine man to look at cave paintings.~
@3954 = ~Well now. Already you've made a distinctly better impression than your cohort.~
@3955 = ~Opportunity knocks, and you bolt the door. These cave paintings had best be *fascinating*, <CHARNAME>.~
@3956 = ~This "other place" you would send us to. Does it belong to you?~
@3957 = ~Hardly. If it did, I wouldn't be sending-~
@3958 = ~Then we do not need your leave to plunder it. Any valuables we should happen to find are ours by default, and do not constitute payment. What do *you* offer for this task?~
@3959 = ~My thoughts exactly.~
@3960 = ~For you? Simply put, nothing. If that doesn't suit you, decline.~
@3961 = ~Magic leads to pain and misery, yes. For my enemies. No doubt you'd have me believe this is objectionable, somehow.~
@3962 = ~Disgusting.~
@3963 = ~What manner of imbecile goes looking for jewels in trees?~
@3964 = ~Those gems are worth at least five times as much.~
@3965 = ~Perhaps so, but three hundred was the bounty posted. If the offer didn't suit-~
@3966 = ~I am lodging my dissatisfaction. Be grateful I am doing so verbally.~
@3967 = ~(Relax. I can just steal them back later.)~
@3968 = ~Hmm. It's been some time since I last ate something that could talk. Perhaps rectifying that might shake loose a memory or two...~
@3969 = ~MELICA~ ~N-no, wait! Please! Hear what I have to say!~
@3970 = ~By the hells, is this some sort of epidemic? At this rate I should form a union!~
@3971 = ~Pretty sure there's already an actor's guild.~
@3972 = ~How curious. Talking kindling.~
@3973 = ~Your every word is a step towards your pyre, little girl. I suggest you slow your pace.~
@3974 = ~I rethink spitting bile instead of flames, you insignificant wretch! You'll return to Waterdeep in an urn!~
@3975 = ~Would you settle down?~
@3976 = ~I say we keep it. Your weak-willed hirelings may have succumbed, but we are made of sterner stuff.~
@3977 = ~Ugh. What was I thinking to accept such an errand? I am above this. ~
@3978 = ~I've clearly been too long a human. Soft in skin, soft in mind.~
@3979 = ~What are you talking about?~
@3980 = ~I've been meaning to say. You're awfully small for a dragon.~
@3981 = ~Why not just change back?~
@3982 = ~That's nice. Shut up now.~
@3983 = ~By all the gods, I am so sick of explaining this.~
@3984 = ~I would love nothing more in the world.~
@3985 = ~You are aware that dragons can take human form, yes? I am not sure how, but it appears I've become...stuck.~
@3986 = ~A curse, if I had to guess. A rival seeking to humiliate me, or some copper's idea of a joke. We'll see if he can laugh with my claws in his throat, the frivolous little devilspawn.~
@3987 = ~And it's not just my body. It's my memories. That's the worst part. I can only recall inklings of my life before...this. Glimpses of flight and flames, of *power*...~
@3988 = ~How do you know you're really a dragon, then?~
@3989 = ~That must be frustrating for you.~
@3990 = ~Is there no way you might be restored?~
@3991 = ~I'm supposed to believe this, am I?~
@3992 = ~By the red of my skin, the magic in my blood and the fire in my breast.~
@3993 = ~So you're a sunburned sorceress with indigestion?~
@3994 = ~Frustrating? Imagine you had changed yourself into an earthworm one day and couldn't undo it. Imagine chewing your way through the soil with crows nipping at your flesh, all while remembering how it was to have hands and feet and size. "Frustration" is not adequate.~
@3995 = ~There is. There must be. Even the gods' magic is not irreversible. But it is difficult to find a cure when one doesn't yet know the disease.~
@3996 = ~I'm supposed appease your scepticism, am I? Believe whatever you like. Just know that when the truth does come out, it will be dark times for all who doubted me. ~
@3997 = ~Ugh. As if it weren't bad enough being saddled with a <PRO_RACE>, it has to be one who thinks they're clever. Be thankful my condition offends me more than you.~
@3998 = ~This must be frustrating for you.~
@3999 = ~For now, my only choice is to distract myself until I can conjure some sort of lead. Hmph. "Distract myself." Yes, perhaps enough menial labour will help me forget the shrunken, crippled misery of humanity. Let us press on before I start entertaining suicide, shall we?~
@4000 = ~My hoard.~
@4001 = ~I remember. Sometimes I would take human form to admire my hoard. Perhaps it happened then...~
@4002 = ~Why would you do that?~
@4003 = ~Are you still on about this?~
@4004 = ~A hoard? Can you take us to it?~
@4005 = ~Good for you. Now be quiet.~
@4006 = ~I often find that looking up at a heap of treasure is more satisfying than looking down.~
@4007 = ~Yes I am. Are you still on about your dead father substitute and these bounties on your head? Then spare me the eye-rolling.~
@4008 = ~<CHARNAME>, if I remembered where it was, the only word you'd have heard from me is "goodbye." If that.~
@4009 = ~Yes, it does make sense. I remember a glittering mountain fit to avalanche a capital. All mine. But...no, that can't be it. Why would I leave it behind? Even as a human, even remembering nothing, I would know. I would see the worth.~
@4010 = ~Perhaps you realised there's more to life.~
@4011 = ~What's the purpose of riches if they go unused?~
@4012 = ~You could hardly have carried it all.~
@4013 = ~That would be delusion, not "realisation." There is nothing more. ~
@4014 = ~Then I would have stayed with it. I would never look on such grandeur and turn away. Not ever. You could open my skull and scoop out everything inside and still my craving would linger.~
@4015 = ~That which has value should be kept. A simple truth that so many fail to grasp.~
@4016 = ~But gold only has value in what it affords you.~
@4017 = ~So you amass a pile of wealth just to run your fingers through it?~
@4018 = ~I think I grasp it well enough.~
@4019 = ~To you, perhaps. I can "afford" whatever I have the power to take.~
@4020 = ~Gold has value in what it is. The lustre, the smell, that symphonious jingle...keep your harps and your lutes, for there is no finer music.~
@4021 = ~Any metal can shine and rattle.~
@4022 = ~I'd rather spend gold than listen to it.~
@4023 = ~You eat food just to digest it? You inhale air just to fill your lungs? The answer is yes, <CHARNAME>. Simply yes. Some things are so elementary that they do not bear explanation. You either understand or you don't.~
@4024 = ~Do you? Or do you collect gold with a mind to spend it? That is not keeping it. That is simply having it.~
@4025 = ~You must be willing to fight and kill for every last coin. You must teach the world that you will *never* be denied what is yours. Only then will you see. Only then will you live.~
@4026 = ~And any meat can fill the belly. Why slaughter cattle when you can catch rats?~
@4027 = ~The sentiment of the deaf.~
@4028 = ~Enough. I must ruminate. This sickness may be worse than I feared.~
@4029 = ~Look, <CHARNAME>! My scales are returning! What further proof do you need? Not that you had any right to doubt.~
@4030 = ~No curse could bind me forever. By Tiamat, I'll overcome this yet.~
@4031 = ~I'm sure you'll be back to terrorising the coast by the month's end.~
@4032 = ~Good gods, you were actually telling the truth.~
@4033 = ~Maybe you just need some ointment.~
@4034 = ~Overcome it quietly, please.~
@4035 = ~In no small measure. There's no better way to stretch the wings than a good rampage.~
@4036 = ~*Some* species do not invent outlandish lies to impress strangers.~
@4037 = ~Hah. I should like to see the salve that can soften dragonhide.~
@4038 = ~Look at them. The sheen, the rigidity. Any blade that struck these would leave its edge behind, there is no denying it.~
@4039 = ~And red, of course. I knew they'd be red and not gold. Sanctimonious snake-kin.~
@4040 = ~So that's it? You just have to wait and eventually you'll turn back to normal?~
@4041 = ~I'd rather not inspect your scabs.~
@4042 = ~Gold would be better. You could do with a bit of nobility.~
@4043 = ~Perhaps, but I won't let it be that simple. There must be some way to hasten the process. Every second I spend on two feet is another second too long.~
@4044 = ~My mood today almost colours you droll. Though not quite.~
@4045 = ~"Nobility" is not yours to define. The only gold that interests me is the minted kind.~
@4046 = ~But frankly, I expected you to be more excited. Does it not thrill you that soon a full-fledged dragon shall walk in your midst? ~
@4047 = ~More terrified than thrilled, to be honest.~
@4048 = ~I'll just be sad to see you go. You've been a helpful ally.~
@4049 = ~I've never thought of dragons as particularly thrilling.~
@4050 = ~Is that so? And what is your opinion worth? You who have never seen a dragon outside of a book? We are the greatest creatures to walk the earth, course the skies and swim the seas. That is FACT.~
@4051 = ~As well you should be. We are the greatest creatures to walk the earth, course the skies and swim the seas. That is fact.~
@4052 = ~Ah, but a dragon's favour is worth more than anything I can provide as some paltry human sorceress. We are the greatest creatures to walk the earth, course the skies and swim the seas. That is fact.~
@4053 = ~*Perhaps* there are beings as wise as dragons, or as strong, or as majestic, but never all three. We are second to gods, and only some even then.~
@4054 = ~Such arrogance can be dangerous, Flara.~
@4055 = ~Yeah yeah, so you say.~
@4056 = ~Some creatures have those qualities and more. What of angels, or demons?~
@4057 = ~Are you done boasting? Because I'm done listening.~
@4058 = ~Arrogance is *unwarranted* confidence. I am humble if anything. And it has always been my lot to say and do as I please. No amount of danger will take that from me.~
@4059 = ~I do say, and you would do well to listen. I have perspective that you will never grasp. I understand what it is to live unburdened, to look upon mountains and oceans and flames and know that none of them may hinder me.~
@4060 = ~Hah. I have precious little to envy them. Even the greatest of extraplanars are slaves to their own nature.~
@4061 = ~Dragons are many things, but above all, <CHARNAME>, above all else, we are free.~
@4062 = ~I should like to humour that man, <CHARNAME>. I'm not who he thinks I am, but he might know something nonetheless.~
@4063 = ~Flara. Think carefully. Are you absolutely sure you haven't met him?~
@4064 = ~Then we'll head there as soon as possible.~
@4065 = ~We're a little busy right now, Flara.~
@4066 = ~Maybe you want to humour him, but I don't want to humour you. Go and do it yourself.~
@4067 = ~If I am the dragon he spoke of, he may have been there when I attacked. That doesn't mean I should remember. You don't remember the face of every bandit you kill, and you certainly don't call them "Uncle." Uncle Gurdie, no less. Ugh.~
@4068 = ~We needn't go promptly. In fact, it might be wiser to keep him waiting. If it matters to him, he'll be patient. If it doesn't, he was obviously wasting my time. Consider the task at our leisure.~
@4069 = ~So be it. And if this should lead to my restoration, know that you have just squandered any gratitude you might have incurred.~
@4070 = ~Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. All of it. Vicious, insidious lies.~
@4071 = ~Those people could have been anyone. Don't let it bother you.~
@4072 = ~And yet you're still dwelling on it.~
@4073 = ~What's it going to take for you to accept the truth?~
@4074 = ~I AM NOT LETTING IT BOTHER ME!~
@4075 = ~The outrage! No-one should even have the nerve to *speak* to me without my permission, let alone attempt such brazen swindling!~
@4076 = ~What's it going to take for *you* to accept it?! ~
@4077 = ~Why did I ever agree to meet them? Why are they still drawing breath?! We should go back. I will not let this stand. I can NOT...~
@4078 = ~We'll get back as soon as we can.~
@4079 = ~I doubt they're still there, Flara.~
@4080 = ~You can go if you want, but you're going alone.~
@4081 = ~Never mind. It can wait. It has to wait. ~
@4082 = ~Argh! How can anyone stand this helplessness? Every time I think of some clue, some possible solution, a dozen reasons surface why I can't pursue it! All because of this useless, stunted shape!~
@4083 = ~How do you live knowing how little you're capable of? How do you bear the weight of all everything you can't do without going mad? ~
@4084 = ~You're still capable of plenty. You're just not used to having to work for it.~
@4085 = ~Actually, I went mad quite a while ago.~
@4086 = ~I don't know. With this useless, stunted shape, I can hardly give you good advice.~
@4087 = ~I would rather be an animal than this. At least then I wouldn't miss what I'd lost. What a cursed, cursed thing to know your own fragility.~
@4088 = ~I've tried, you know. When I realised I had no immediate fix, I tried to think of some advantage to the situation. One thing about it to appreciate. To make it more bearable.~
@4089 = ~There is none. I am diminished in every way I can be. And it is the worst kind of hatred, <CHARNAME>, to hate what you are.~
@4090 = ~These people who *claim* to be my family...~
@4091 = ~What about them?~
@4092 = ~You're still not over that?~
@4093 = ~Oh gods, just shut up.~
@4094 = ~Let's...hypothesize that it is true. As an exercise.~
@4095 = ~What would that imply about me? Delusion, first of all. Deep, deep madness with no apparent origin.~
@4096 = ~And physical aberration. Humans aren't known for their scales. They certainly aren't known for breathing fire, or for being immune to it. I'm sure you've seen me touching candle flames? I barely feel it.~
@4097 = ~Ask me to name the draconic pantheon. I'll do it in one breath. Could any commoner manage that? No. I know every kind of dragon, their natures, their elements.~
@4098 = ~Do you see how unlikely this all is? It's ridiculous to suggest that it's all some accident. No coincidence is this great.~
@4099 = ~Was I suggesting that?~
@4100 = ~You can find loonies who think they're something they're not in any city.~
@4101 = ~You can find loonies who think they're something they're not in any city. Just look at Tiax.~
@4102 = ~Didn't Sigurd say you were obsessed with dragons as a youth? That would explain your knowledge of them.~
@4103 = ~Maybe you're only descended from dragons. ~
@4104 = ~Not aloud. Don't pretend you aren't thinking it.~
@4105 = ~I believe what you say, Flara. I honestly do.~
@4106 = ~Attention seekers. Or drunks. I'm lucid as a diamond, <CHARNAME>. I simply hear people call me a human and I know, I just *know* that it's wrong. As much as you'd know it was wrong if someone said you were a fish.~
@4107 = ~I'm often told I drink like one. And I want to say they're wrong, but I know I'd be lying to myself.~
@4108 = ~What's the point of discussing this when you've already dismissed every other possibility?~
@4109 = ~How, exactly? Because I'd read stories? Half fiction and half embellished truths?~
@4110 = ~And regardless, knowing trivia isn't the same as knowing how they think. Their philosophy. That which has value should be kept. I remember living by no other creed.~
@4111 = ~How "they" think?~
@4112 = ~<CHARNAME>. Do you have the slightest idea how rare draconic crossbreeds are? Why would anyone want their offspring to be so crippled? Even humans understand that much.~
@4113 = ~Yet it still happens.~
@4114 = ~Well then you agree. Yes? Any other possibility is too absurd to be worth consideration. I must be right. Yes? Good. I'm glad we discussed this.~
@4115 = ~Don't. I am not in the mood.~
@4116 = ~I said it was an exercise, not a discussion. I'm making it clear that those people aren't who they say they are. That is all.~
@4117 = ~Good. It's clear. Now let's go.~
@4118 = ~Making it clear to whom?~
@4119 = ~I'm not interested in your desperate rationalisations. ~
@4120 = ~We! How *we* think! Don't be such an insufferable pedant!~
@4121 = ~If I were half-dragon, only the blind would take me for human. And if I were any less, I would not have the fire in me. Our blood does not bear dilution. ~
@4122 = ~Good, then.~
@4123 = ~You! Who else was I speaking to?!~
@4124 = ~Desperate, are they? Perhaps if you'd engage that sorry raisin of a brain, you'd see the logic.  My fault for expecting anything of a <PRO_RACE>.~
@4125 = ~Desperate, are they? Perhaps if you'd engage that sorry raisin of a brain, you'd see the logic.  My fault for expecting anything of an <PRO_RACE>.~
@4126 = ~This is that foul wand, I assume.~
@4127 = ~Decrepit old thing. It's been polished, but you can still see the dust in the cracks. Netherese, I would guess.~
@4128 = ~I could study this, perhaps. Most of the magic is spent, but there's always a trace. If I can determine the exact spells used in its creation, I may be able to reverse them.~
@4129 = ~Or...~
@4130 = ~*snap*~
@4131 = ~What was that for?~
@4132 = ~That better not have been worth anything.~
@4133 = ~Starting to like being human, then?~
@4134 = ~For dragonkind.~
@4135 = ~Less than nothing.~
@4136 = ~No. But that is not what mattered.~
@4137 = ~If I can overcome this through my will alone, it shall be so. I do not unlock chains. I break them.~
@4138 = ~And I will not suffer this vile thing to exist. I will not risk it ever being used again. *No* dragon deserves this. Not even a silver. Not even my worst rival. I would tear their head from their body and burn them black, but I would never do this. There is no dignity in it.~
@4139 = ~I'll incinerate this tonight, with my own fire. That will be its end.~
@4140 = ~<CHARNAME>, something has been bothering me.~
@4141 = ~Sigurd wanted you to turn me over to him, did he not? I assume he must have offered some incentive. Gold or the like. Why did you not accept it?~
@4142 = ~Because you're my friend.~
@4143 = ~It was a paltry sum. I took offence to it.~
@4144 = ~They planned to sell you to an alchemist. I couldn't condone such acts.~
@4145 = ~I just wanted to wipe the smirk off his face.~
@4146 = ~I'm...not quite sure what to say to that.~
@4147 = ~Hah! Quite right, <CHARNAME>. Quite right indeed. Now we have everything he offered and more. See, the dragon's way is not so strange.~
@4148 = ~To be kept like some farm animal, is that it? Milked for blood and sheared for scales? I truly would go mad, I think.~
@4149 = ~That simple? I suppose I should be glad his smirk was so irritating, then.~
@4150 = ~But regardless, you fought for my sake. You revealed the truth to me. And the thought occurs that I never...exactly...thanked you.~
@4151 = ~No thanks are necessary.~
@4152 = ~Whenever you're ready, then.~
@4153 = ~Half your hoard should suffice.~
@4154 = ~Oh, just be *quiet* for a moment, will you? I'll decide what I make a fuss over, and my approval is not some triviality for you to dismiss!~
@4155 = ~*ahem* Well.~
@4156 = ~There's no point in me actually saying it, is there? Words are worth little. But I assure you, my memory for favours is almost as long as my memory for transgressions.~
@4157 = ~Half?! I would sooner have let them take me!~
@4158 = ~I do not give, <CHARNAME>, and I do not indebt myself. It would # I am. What I *know* I am.~
@4159 = ~But I will remember. Should this quest of yours grow wearisome, I will remember. Should you find your life in danger, I will remember. And in the future, if I should meet those who call themselves your enemy, I will remember.~
@4160 = ~My my. Aren't you a lovely couple?~
@4161 = ~Those emeralds were stolen, Flara. We're turning them in.~
@4162 = ~And they'll fetch a lovely sum of gold.~
@4163 = ~Just try not to eat them or something.~
@4164 = ~Oh, stolen from whom? Some nobleman who'd squander them on wine or gambling or some other transient hedonism? That which has value should be kept!~
@4165 = ~By us!~
@4166 = ~Ugh. Must you? Not that I don't appreciate coin, but you could stand to broaden your palate.~
@4167 = ~Oh, gods damn you! I wouldn't have thought it if you hadn't said it! Quickly, put them somewhere I can't see them. Or smell them.~
@4168 = ~And that was all it took to bring the iron trade to its knees? A smattering of kobolds shepherded by some halfwit orc?~
@4169 = ~Perhaps I should round up some goblins and have them run amok in a gold mine. If wailing and griping is the only opposition the locals can muster, I could control the whole region's bullion before they even thought to investigate.~
@4170 = ~You know I'd have to stop you too, don't you?~
@4171 = ~If only we knew where the nearest gold mine was.~
@4172 = ~Did you miss the part where it ended in failure and death?~
@4173 = ~Anyone with ambition and half a brain could put this place to heel. I've known it the minute I stepped out of Candlekeep.~
@4174 = ~You could try, but this time I'd be commanding your foes, not you. You'd not even make it to the entrance.~
@4175 = ~Oh, I can sniff that out easily enough. The goblins, however...as a human, cowing them into submission would be more of a challenge. I shall shelve the notion for a more opportune time, I think.~
@4176 = ~Only because I chose to intervene. I'm hardly likely to foil my own schemes, am I?~
@4177 = ~Yes. Raiding is all well and good, but I won't always be so full of vigour. In a millennium or two, my older, sleepier self would welcome a less intensive means of profit.~
@4178 = ~Then again, to poison gold as they did iron, all that precious gleam fading and crumbling to sediment...ugh. No. Far too distasteful.~
@4179 = ~Perhaps I shall tarry here a while longer. I see there's something to be made from this adventuring business, and it does keep one travelling. A fair way to occupy myself while I seek restoration.~
@4180 = ~I would be honoured to have you.~
@4181 = ~Whatever. I suppose there's no getting rid of you.~
@4182 = ~Certainly fairer than taking innkeepers to task over the name of their establishment.~
@4183 = ~If you plan to tag along, I'm going to need you to stop talking to me. Long-term.~
@4184 = ~You'll have to seek it alone. We part ways here.~
@4185 = ~To serve me, you mean. And it goes without saying.~
@4186 = ~Not so. Speaking to me in such a manner may very well do it.~
@4187 = ~Oh yes! That's why I came here, isn't it? Because of that ridiculous tavern. And it shall be remedied still, mark my words. Our deeds here may not yield results immediately, but I won't let that fool off lightly by forgetting. Give me that journal.~
@4188 = ~Frankly, I'm not sure why I bothered in the first place.~
@4189 = ~Hmph. I'll be better off for it, no doubt. I'd say "fare well", but I don't imagine you will.~
@4190 = ~Honestly, <CHARNAME>, why the subterfuge? Let us storm the place and seize its plunder!~
@4191 = ~I intend to. It'll just be easier to storm from the inside out.~
@4192 = ~I'd rather settle this with as little death as possible.~
@4193 = ~Oh, I'm going to rob the place. I'd just rather not fight.~
@4194 = ~I'm the leader here.~
@4195 = ~Ah. Good, then. I knew you had some sense in you.~
@4196 = ~Explain to me what is served by leaving your enemies alive. With their ill-gotten gains in hand, I might add. Quite substantial gains, it would seem...~
@4197 = ~That will do, then. Though I'd much rather conquer than pilfer.~
@4198 = ~Or so I allow you to think.~
@4199 = ~How long have these bandits plagued the coast, I wonder? How many merchants robbed, how much iron sold back to those it was taken from?~
@4200 = ~All those riches, soon to be mine.~
@4201 = ~You mean ours.~
@4202 = ~Wipe your mouth. You're drooling.~
@4203 = ~Is gold all you care about?~
@4204 = ~No. No, I don't.~
@4205 = ~Oh gods, I really am. How unseemly.~
@4206 = ~No, but it's all I'm likely to find here. And you're in no position to criticise, unless you're here purely for heroism's sake.~
@4207 = ~Yes, actually. I am.~
@4208 = ~Everything I take goes towards a greater cause.~
@4209 = ~You've got me there.~
@4210 = ~There is something to be said for this, perhaps. Stealing from thieves. It saves one the trouble of picking out the valuables.~
@4211 = ~The disappointment of overturning a local village, only to find they have nothing but bread and livestock...ugh. It's too cruel, <CHARNAME>. Too cruel.~
@4212 = ~Notice all the tears I'm not shedding.~
@4213 = ~If you only went after bandits, you'd probably be admired more than feared.~
@4214 = ~Doesn't all the slaughter and ruination make up for it?~
@4215 = ~Rather like picking someone pockets and getting a handful of lint.~
@4216 = ~Then I assume you'll be leaving the loot where it lies. That suits me fine. If you prove yourself a hypocrite, I am vindicated. If not, more for me.~
@4217 = ~Likewise. What cause could be greater than building my hoard?~
@4218 = ~Indeed. Do try and shed the self-righteousness, <CHARNAME>. It doesn't become you. It doesn't become anyone.~
@4219 = ~Obviously. You've never had to endure it. ~
@4220 = ~Is that supposed to encourage the idea or put me off it?~
@4221 = ~Slaughter and ruination are means to an end, <CHARNAME>. I don't kill just for the sake of killing.~
@4222 = ~Well. Not habitually.~
@4223 = ~Oh. Yes. A skinned knee is the same sort of thing as a broken leg, isn't it? Broadly speaking.~
@4224 = ~In any case, do continue making wealthy enemies. You can't deny it's more productive than swatting xvarts. ~
@4225 = ~Here we are, then. The very epicentre of thievery, with spoils stashed in every nook.~
@4226 = ~What a dismal place for a reckoning. Still, I shouldn't be surprised. Yours is not the sort of tale to conclude in daylit streets, amidst the throngs of mediocrity.~
@4227 = ~How fare you, then? Are you confident?~
@4228 = ~The end approaches. I can only pray we all live to see it.~
@4229 = ~I believe I can win this battle, but what comes afterwards...~
@4230 = ~Sarevok is the deadliest warrior I've ever seen. He struck Gorion down with barely an effort. I may not have the luxury of confidence.~
@4231 = ~Confident enough. Sarevok is on the run, his plans shattered. We need only remember that cornered rats fight harder.~
@4232 = ~Of course. Nothing could stop me before, and nothing will stop me now.~
@4233 = ~You sound uncertain, <CHARNAME>. Fearful. Be rid of it. If your resolve should falter now, you will die a mere inch from victory's precipice, and that will not do. That will not do at all. Perhaps I shall have to intercede here.~
@4234 = ~Repeat after me; I am strong.~
@4235 = ~I am strong.~
@4236 = ~What is this? What are you doing?~
@4237 = ~Good. Our acquaintance has been brief, but you've proven yourself to be quite unshakable. Even I could not have predicted the scale of this conspiracy, nor the nature of your involvement. And yet, no matter how tall your hurdles rose, from bandits to consortiums to the essence of murder itself, you remained steadfast.~
@4238 = ~You may have the soul of a god, <CHARNAME>, but you have the heart of a dragon.~
@4239 = ~I dare say you do as well.~
@4240 = ~It means a lot to hear you say that.~
@4241 = ~Praise from Flara? Here I thought I was chasing Sarevok, but it turns out I'm abed, dreaming away.~
@4242 = ~Great. Can we go kill Sarevok now?~
@4243 = ~I am wise. I am majestic. I am free.~
@4244 = ~I. Am. Strong.~
@4245 = ~We don't have time for this, Flara.~
@4246 = ~I have more than the heart, as you are well aware. But sometimes the heart alone is enough.~
@4247 = ~It had better. I've never said it before, and I don't expect to again. Do not forget this moment.~
@4248 = ~A tacit admission that you've dreamed of my approval. I already knew, of course.~
@4249 = ~My magnanimity is rarer than the finest diamonds, and you turn up your nose at it? An efficient way to ensure you won't see it again.  ~
@4250 = ~I am wind and earth, frost and flame.~
@4251 = ~Now come. This Iron Throne already lies in ruin, and naught but stragglers wait ahead. We will make cinders of their flesh and their ambition alike, we will stomp them into the dirt, and let the smoke rising from their smouldering bones be a warning beacon to all of Faerun. Such is the fate of all who dare oppose us. ~
@4252 = ~Thank you. I needed that.~
@4253 = ~I don't know what to say.~
@4254 = ~Damn right.~
@4255 = ~You're seriously trying to give me a pep talk? Get back in character, Flara. You're scaring me.~
@4256 = ~Are you done, or is the plan to wait until Sarevok has to sleep?~
@4257 = ~I am a dragon.~
@4258 = ~I could see as much. Do not let it go to waste.~
@4259 = ~Say nothing, then. Succeed.~
@4260 = ~Damn right indeed.~
@4261 = ~We are dragons. And no fragment of a dead god can withstand us.~
@4262 = ~What is it?~
@4263 = ~We need to discuss something about Sigurd. It's important.~
@4264 = ~I'm guessing a simple curse removal scroll wouldn't do the trick?~
@4265 = ~Now that you're a human, maybe you should take up a hobby besides ravaging and pillaging.~
@4266 = ~Would I be wrong to say we're friends now?~
@4267 = ~I've always wanted to ride a dragon.~
@4268 = ~Can you teach me to speak draconic?~
@4269 = ~I know you're not happy about being human, but are you at least getting used to it?~
@4270 = ~How did you come to be in Nashkel?~
@4271 = ~Is it true what they say about dragons eating virgins?~
@4272 = ~Could you tell me a bit about the draconic gods?~
@4273 = ~Is there any particular dragon god you venerate?~
@4274 = ~Do you not think there's a place for charity in the world?~
@4275 = ~Is there *any* species other than dragons that you actually respect?~
@4276 = ~What about your family, Flara? Would they not come looking for you?~
@4277 = ~What are your thoughts on love, Flara?~
@4278 = ~You are the most beautiful creature I've ever met.~
@4279 = ~Are you ever going to settle that affair with the Belching Dragon?~
@4280 = ~Flara, Gorion's letter said I'm part of Alaundo's prophecy. I'm one of Bhaal's children.~
@4281 = ~Where exactly did you learn about cockfights?~
@4282 = ~You're not thinking of worshipping Tempus, are you?~
@4283 = ~Should I tell Coran to back off?~
@4284 = ~Can we not have you and Dorn at each other's throats, please?~
@4285 = ~How are those dragon tales coming along?~
@4286 = ~How are those blisters now?~
@4287 = ~Am I out of my mind or do you actually like Imoen?~
@4288 = ~You actually used to roll around in your treasure pile?~
@4289 = ~You almost seem sympathetic to Kivan.~
@4290 = ~Are you so desperate for riches that you'd rely on wild surges to conjure them up?~
@4291 = ~The average wingspan of newborn wyrmlings is roughly sixteen feet.~
@4292 = ~You seem to be getting the hang of meditation.~
@4293 = ~Is Xan bothering you?~
@4294 = ~Do you really want Littlun's crossbow that badly?~
@4295 = ~Don't let Vynd get to you. He's like this with everyone.~
@4296 = ~Want a drink, Flara?~
@4297 = ~I am not bleeding. I presume that's close enough to "fine" for your purposes.~
@4298 = ~I bear my wounds with stoicism, as befits me. That said, I don't see why I shouldn't have a designated potion-carrier on hand. Or two.~
@4299 = ~My injuries accrue, <CHARNAME>. If I die a human, you'll have a very angry spectre at your throat.~
@4300 = ~Are you mocking me?!~
@4301 = ~Am I still tiny, soft and withered? Yes? Then we've made no progress.~
@4302 = ~I meant regarding our quest.~
@4303 = ~Good to know.~
@4304 = ~The mines? We haven't dealt with them yet, <CHARNAME>. Must I leash you?~
@4305 = ~It's increasingly less ours and more yours. To be frank, my attention is dwindling.~
@4306 = ~I cannot complain overmuch. Discovering the source of my affliction has proven useful. And you are muddling through your own affairs well enough, I suppose.~
@4307 = ~I've tried just about every "simple" scroll you'd care to name. Wands and potions too. I even considered paying a temple to resurrect me in advance, then cutting my own throat at the altar.~
@4308 = ~You'd really go that far?~
@4309 = ~What? How would that help?~
@4310 = ~I'm sure they'd have fun explaining that to the laity.~
@4311 = ~Why didn't you?~
@4312 = ~And further. I'd flay every inch of this dainty skin if it would free the dragon beneath.~
@4313 = ~Only the mightiest enchantments linger beyond death. Then again, only the mightiest enchantments could bring a dragon low, so perhaps it was doomed to fail.~
@4314 = ~Hmm. Rather glad I realised that before going through with it. I'd prefer not to add "murdered myself for nothing" to my list of indignities.~
@4315 = ~Oh, they wouldn't have had the chance. Had it worked, I'd have killed them and taken the gold back. I have principles, you know.~
@4316 = ~Because anyone with an ounce of sense would keep the gold and leave me to rot.~
@4317 = ~Should I? If you were turned into a dog, would you take up the hobby of playing fetch? Sleeping in a kennel? Sniffing nethers, perhaps?~
@4318 = ~I wouldn't know. It's never happened to me.~
@4319 = ~We're a little more advanced than that, Flara.~
@4320 = ~Surely there's some pastime that wouldn't offend your dignity. What about intellectual pursuits?~
@4321 = ~I do that already.~
@4322 = ~Patience. It shouldn't be long before I can manage a polymorph spell again. I'll even find a ball for you. Then we'll see if you live by your own words.~
@4323 = ~That is truer than you meant it to be, I think. More advanced? Yes. A little? Yes.~
@4324 = ~Ah. Intellectual pursuits. Reading, for example. Yes, perhaps there's some fulfilment to be found in the scrawlings of barely sentient mayfly people. I shall simply *eviscerate* the next library we visit.~
@4325 = ~I'll not feign surprise.~
@4326 = ~Pastimes are for those with time to pass. When I am free of this curse, when I have punished those responsible, then we will speak of pastimes.~
@4327 = ~Would you? Common is such an imprecise language. One word can have a dozen meanings, and hundreds of connotations.~
@4328 = ~I suppose it depends on how you define it. What is a "friend" to you?~
@4329 = ~Someone I can trust above anyone else. Who'd die for me, and I for them.~
@4330 = ~If I enjoy your company, and you enjoy mine, we're friends.~
@4331 = ~There are no rules to it. You just have to care.~
@4332 = ~Then you couldn't be more wrong. I might kill an archer for you, but I won't be standing between you and the arrows. Excepting suitable magical protection, I suppose.~
@4333 = ~I'd take an arrow for you, protection or no.~
@4334 = ~Good enough for me.~
@4335 = ~That hurts me to hear, Flara.~
@4336 = ~I'd be disappointed if you did. You've more sense than that.~
@4337 = ~Pfft. It'd take far less chatter and far more servility before I enjoyed *your* company, <CHARNAME>. At best, you vacillate between a diversion and a headache.~
@4338 = ~That sounds exactly like a friend to me.~
@4339 = ~Well I enjoy yours, at least.~
@4340 = ~Likewise.~
@4341 = ~"Care." Again, the meaning blurs. If you were killed tomorrow, I'd be incensed to have lost an asset, but you'd not catch me shedding tears.~
@4342 = ~Obviously. I'd be dead.~
@4343 = ~Which means you'd be doing it in secret, right?~
@4344 = ~And that sentiment will melt my heart and make me admit that I'd do the same. Is that how you imagined it?~
@4345 = ~No. I just wanted you to know.~
@4346 = ~Am I to assume it didn't work, then?~
@4347 = ~I also imagined a declaration of love, followed by a wild night of passion at the nearest inn.~
@4348 = ~Hmph. That's all it takes? Rather broadening the term to suit your purposes, I think. Very well, if it puts a smile on that silly face, you may tell everyone you've befriended a dragon. Just don't say it's me.~
@4349 = ~Would you rather hear soft lies than hard truths? I'll at least confess a modicum of esteem for you, <CHARNAME>. Don't destroy it with this lip-quivering.~
@4350 = ~A practical understanding, then. If that's what you consider friendship, so be it, but perhaps you should learn the word "alliance."~
@4351 = ~I shall adjust my tactics accordingly.~
@4352 = ~I'll remind you that I'm a red dragon, <CHARNAME>. Quite immune to melting, of any persuasion.~
@4353 = ~This. This is the point of contention. If not for these woeful strainings towards wit, I might have had a more favourable answer.~
@4354 = ~When we first met, that impertinence would have angered me. Now I tolerate it. Take that for its worth and stop prattling.~
@4355 = ~Oh? Basking in my grace, are you? You'll have the privilege for a while yet, if that means anything.~
@4356 = ~Was that directed at me? I can promise you it won't happen, whichever way you meant it. I can also promise catastrophic reprisal if you should ever make the attempt.~
@4357 = ~Again, whichever way you meant it. ~
@4358 = ~Can I? Or will I? The answers differ.~
@4359 = ~Why won't you?~
@4360 = ~What if I paid you for the trouble?~
@4361 = ~I already know a little, actually.~
@4362 = ~Because it would take years for you to reach even a troglodyte's grasp of the language. The grammar, the syntax, is wholly different from what you're accustomed to. And your tongue is the wrong shape.~
@4363 = ~Hmm. An exorbitant fee, but if you could somehow scrape it together...~
@4364 = ~No. Nothing is worth listening to you brutalise my native tongue for months on end. You'd be cinders before your second lesson.~
@4365 = ~Do you.~
@4366 = ~Ava'yorn! Svanoa re wux? (Hello! How are you?)~
@4367 = ~Shilta wux majak ve myvillion ekess wer isepl? (Can you give me directions to the inn?)~
@4368 = ~Wer rasv'kled di nomeno, petranas? (How much is this, please?)~
@4369 = ~Kiq dolruth zklaen tepoha jiil vivex persvek fogah nibel ferlarw. Throdenilt jiil nibel ferlarw, ui yscik ekess dolruth vi cekip. (Each pass must have two victory in three chessboad. Exceed two chessboad, is able to pass a test.)~
@4370 = ~You're not interested in a demonstration, then?~
@4371 = ~Why do you want to learn, anyway? Are you looking to translate for the kobolds we've been butchering? I guarantee you'll deem it wasted effort.~
@4372 = ~Why? What do they say?~
@4373 = ~I just like to learn new things.~
@4374 = ~Because it's a language of magic and ancient secrets.~
@4375 = ~Surely immersing myself in such a proud culture can only better me.~
@4376 = ~Splendid. Perhaps next you'll count to ten for me, though I doubt you can manage that even in your own language.~
@4377 = ~"The inn." And then you simply have to hope there's only one inn, yes?~
@4378 = ~Not a phrase I've found much use for.~
@4379 = ~The answer is no, <CHARNAME>.~
@4380 = ~I'd say you're perceptive, but if you were, you wouldn't have needed to ask.~
@4381 = ~"Attack!" "Flee!" And assorted expletives. Though one admittedly had some sharp observations on your female ancestry.~
@4382 = ~Then you have a whole smorgasbord before you. Choose another dish.~
@4383 = ~It is. So you understand why we aren't keen to share.~
@4384 = ~Jumping into a pile of gold won't make you more valuable, barring the odd piece that sticks in your boot.~
@4385 = ~Incidentally, if that was your best enunciation, you've not convinced me the task would be any smaller. You sound like a dullard with trismus.~
@4386 = ~No, and I'm making a conscious effort not to. Every time I damage these flimsy fingernails, every time I have to adjust this robe, every time I try to scratch a wing that isn't there, it's all the more incentive to be rid of this nonsense. I will not allow myself any complacency.~
@4387 = ~Vynd has a nail file you can borrow.~
@4388 = ~You have phantom wings?~
@4389 = ~Not to be lewd, but nobody's forcing you to wear the robe.~
@4390 = ~That's not a healthy attitude, Flara.~
@4391 = ~You're half right about that.~
@4392 = ~It's driving me to distraction, I swear. I thought my first order of business after recovery would be to check on my hoard, but now? Before anything else, I shall have an intimate eve with a pumice stone.~
@4393 = ~Going without invites more untoward comments than I have Magic Missiles. And it's cold.~
@4394 = ~Isn't it? Well this isn't a healthy condition. I won't accept it, <CHARNAME>. Never.~
@4395 = ~The same way I've come to be anywhere recently, much to my annoyance. I walked.~
@4396 = ~I meant what brought you there?~
@4397 = ~You didn't think to hire a horse?~
@4398 = ~What's wrong with walking? It's good exercise.~
@4399 = ~Thoughts of a roof and a fire. And perhaps a trace of the instinct that draws any self-respecting dragon to vulnerable settlements.~
@4400 = ~Horses detest me. They sense what I am, I think, which makes them more intelligent than some who claim sapience.~
@4401 = ~None of which translates through polymorphosis. All this stick-legged mucktrudging amounts to little but sore feet. My queendom for a flight potion...~
@4402 = ~Neither Nashkel nor its hayseeds hold any significance to me, if that's what you want to know. I meant to rest there a night, then leave. Nothing more. If the...ugh..."Belching Dragon" hadn't drawn my attention, we would likely have passed each other by.~
@4403 = ~I doubt it. You're hardly just another face in the crowd.~
@4404 = ~Damn that tavern.~
@4405 = ~I still don't understand why you pitched a fit over that, of all things.~
@4406 = ~No, but you are.~
@4407 = ~Wait, what do you mean by that?~
@4408 = ~*sigh* A fraying rope takes less weight.~
@4409 = ~Ugh. Male dragons, mostly.~
@4410 = ~Typical.~
@4411 = ~I take it you disapprove?~
@4412 = ~Um. Why?~
@4413 = ~I've eaten a few in my time, if you know what I mean.~
@4414 = ~Much as I hate to admit it, some things do transcend species.~
@4415 = ~Not exactly. It is always right that dragons do as they please. I just find it...uncomfortable.~
@4416 = ~I suspect the reasons have become distorted over time.~
@4417 = ~I don't, nor do I want to hear your explanation. And if you waggle your eyebrows like that again, I'll burn them off.~
@4418 = ~Traditionally, virgin women are valued in human society. They are unclaimed and fit for breeding. So when a dragon wanted a sacrifice from the townsfolk, they would demand a young and beautiful maiden, because that was whom they were least willing to give. It asserted dominance.~
@4419 = ~But if you ask a male dragon these days, he'll tell you they're a delicacy. That they taste better. It's always struck me as perverse. I mean...do they *check* first? And why should it matter if they've...? In terms of...flavour...it can't possibly...~
@4420 = ~This topic is closed. It's disgusting.~
@4421 = ~A bit? Such as what? Garyx is the god of destruction? Bahamut is the god of pretentious ideals? Little niblets that you won't have to chew?~
@4422 = ~If you're asking for a proper lecture on our pantheon, I do not have the time and you do not have the attention span. If you're asking for superficial factoids, go and read a book.~
@4423 = ~All of them.~
@4424 = ~What, even the good ones?~
@4425 = ~Even Bahamut?~
@4426 = ~All of them? How many are there?~
@4427 = ~That's a long way to stretch your devotions.~
@4428 = ~"The good ones." Of course you would divide gods into neat and tidy categories. That way you needn't think about those under the wrong heading.~
@4429 = ~Even him. I doubt it's an easy thing for you to grasp.~
@4430 = ~Why? You think I'm spreading myself thin, as it were? Any more than three or four is too many? That is not how my mind works.~
@4431 = ~Only to one of your species.~
@4432 = ~Humans and their ilk choose a single god that suits them, as if they're trying on a tunic. "I am a farmer, so I shall worship Chauntea. I am a knight, so I shall worship Torm." It's childish and myopic. The path of least resistance.~
@4433 = ~Naturally, I honour Tiamat, goddess of the chromatic dragons. But Bahamut merits respect, in his own way. I may scoff at his crusades and his coddling of the weak, but those are not the only qualities he promotes. Strength. Bravery. Majesty. All dragons should exemplify such traits.~
@4434 = ~And Tamara, the goddess of mercy. I pay homage to her. This surprises you as well, I suppose?~
@4435 = ~Now you're just pulling my leg.~
@4436 = ~Not really. I never know what to expect from you.~
@4437 = ~Surprises and disappoints. I thought you had more mettle.~
@4438 = ~Yes, but only because you admitted you actually paid something to someone.~
@4439 = ~Mercy is not some strange thing to me. To spare your enemies is contemptible, but that is only one kind of mercy.~
@4440 = ~Even dragons grow old, <CHARNAME>. In our twilight years, our bones creak and our faculties wane, as any mortal being's do. And none of us wishes to leave this world dribbling and delirious.~
@4441 = ~Once we've made our peace, we fall upon our younger kin and dare anyone and everyone to try their claws. And so they do. We fight and curse till our fury is spent forever, but there is no ill will in it. Behind all the blood and bellowing lies a simple, quiet understanding. And in the end, we die gloriously in the flames of our brothers and sisters. A good death.~
@4442 = ~Mercy of that sort is beautiful and admirable. It should not go unrecognised.~
@4443 = ~Of course there's a place for it. As far from me as possible.~
@4444 = ~No. And you've taken it as a personal slight, I assume.~
@4445 = ~It's not that I scorn your kind, current predicament notwithstanding. I look at you as you would, say, a goat. Do you hate goats? Of course you don't. But if a goat were to ask "Why do you think you're better than me?" you'd be hard-pressed to give more of an answer than "Because I am."~
@4446 = ~That isn't my view. I'm not superior or inferior to any animal.~
@4447 = ~But you're not any better than we are at the moment.~
@4448 = ~I actually do hate goats. There was an...incident in my childhood.~
@4449 = ~When you put it that way, it does make sense.~
@4450 = ~How about "Because I'm an uppity, self-absorbed twit"?~
@4451 = ~What a sickeningly sweet lie. If you do believe that, <CHARNAME>, you're wrong. Provably. But if you must play the druid, let us instead compare mortals and deities. You wouldn't tilt your head to the skies and ask the gods why they don't see you as an equal. So why ask it of a dragon?~
@4452 = ~That is still very much up for debate. But if it *is* true, it's because I'm forced to be one of you.~
@4453 = ~Sheep, then. Cattle. You understand the point. I'm not going to stand here and list livestock until we find one you abide by.~
@4454 = ~It's a fact of life. You find it distasteful because you had the poor fortune to be made lesser...which I empathise with more and more by the day...but it is so, no matter how much you wish it wasn't.~
@4455 = ~I will let that pass, because I understand where it came from. But don't press your luck.~
@4456 = ~I assume you mean my actual family, not those human pretenders.~
@4457 = ~To be succinct, no. Red dragons raise themselves. If my parents care to know where I am, or even whether I'm alive or dead, it is out of wariness and nothing more. And I doubt I have siblings.~
@4458 = ~That sounds terribly lonely.~
@4459 = ~Why bother having children if you won't be a part of their lives?~
@4460 = ~So there's no chance you could go to them for help.~
@4461 = ~Because you are instinctively predisposed to seek company. Millennia of breeding have imprinted on you that there is safety in numbers. Not so for us. Other dragons are competitors far more often than allies.~
@4462 = ~If I were to find my mother or father, that is all I would be to them. A competitor. There is no succour to be had there.~
@4463 = ~Do you think we need mothering? Even a wyrmling stands atop the food chain in all but the most vicious ecosystems.~
@4464 = ~Besides, we've no desire to die out. And the urge to mate is...well. A difficult thing to deny. Or so I understand.~
@4465 = ~Ask Coran.~
@4466 = ~Oof! A low blow!~
@4467 = ~Even if I somehow found them, the best case scenario is them laughing me out of their lair and me being remembered as the first dragon ever to die of shame. No thank you.~
@4468 = ~That depends on how you're using the term. Applied to wealth and power, it's practically tautological. Applied to other people, it's just another word for silliness.~
@4469 = ~Very good. Any more obvious truths you'd like to announce?~
@4470 = ~Your hair is like a shimmering flame...~
@4471 = ~Your eyes are like rubies...~
@4472 = ~Your figure is statuesque...~
@4473 = ~No, I'll just take the hint and leave.~
@4474 = ~IT WASN'T AN INVITATION.~
@4475 = ~Oh. That? Do you know, I'd quite forgotten about it. Hardly worth the bother now, at any rate.~
@4476 = ~Of course I don't want...~
@4477 = ~Well. Perhaps. I've never actually tried spirits before. I might as well see what the fuss is about.~
@4478 = ~Something...fiery. And expensive.~
@4479 = ~What was that...that thing I had last time? That they make with a whisk.~
@4480 = ~Whisky?~
@4481 = ~Yes. Get that. And in a proper mug this time. Not one of those pixie cups.~
@4482 = ~You want a tankard of whisky.~
@4483 = ~I don't see the sense in pouring a mouthful at a time, do you?~
@4484 = ~I suppose you did this as some sort of joke? If you're expecting an outburst, I'll have to disappoint you. When you're trapped in the wrong species, gender is a distant concern at best.~
@4485 = ~I may leave it on, in fact. It should certainly keep Coran at bay.~
@4486 = ~...interesting.~
@4487 = ~I'm sure you'll not hesitate to cry hypocrisy if I doubt you. Not that I do, I suppose. It explains too much.~
@4488 = ~Why, may I ask, did you tell me this?~
@4489 = ~I don't want to keep secrets from my companions. Better I tell you now than you find out later.~
@4490 = ~Because it worries me. I needed to talk to someone.~
@4491 = ~I thought you might finally show me some respect.~
@4492 = ~I dunno. Better than talking about the weather, isn't it?~
@4493 = ~You fear I would turn on you? Decry you as a monster? I am not some squeamish, swooning gentlesoul to balk at your origins, and you know that. Be as much of a mystery as you please, <CHARNAME>. The only thing I don't want you hiding from me is treasure.~
@4494 = ~And you come to me for reassurance? Has the revelation already driven you to madness, then? Rather a sharp decline.~
@4495 = ~This should *gladden* you. Your trials are greater than they've ever been, and now, as you approach the breaking point, a whole new well of power surfaces, eager to be tapped. It's serendipity. Seize it.~
@4496 = ~Do not raise your hopes overmuch. You are no god, <CHARNAME>, only half of one. But I grant that my participation in your journey henceforth shall perhaps be...less indifferent.~
@4497 = ~You do have the option to not talk at all, <CHARNAME>. I wonder if anyone has informed you.~
@4498 = ~I doubt that. But continue.~
@4499 = ~He and his party did this to you. Apparently they used some kind of ancient wand designed to subdue dragons. Now he's trying to convince you you're just a human, so you'll stop resisting the magic.~
@4500 = ~I really do think you should give him a chance. What if he is who he says he is?~
@4501 = ~He's extremely handsome. Have you staked any claims? Because if not, I'm making my move.~
@4502 = ~A wand.~
@4503 = ~So he says.~
@4504 = ~An *ancient* wand.~
@4505 = ~If it makes you feel better, they knew they couldn't beat you otherwise.~
@4506 = ~So my curse is no accident. That man set out to hunt me.~
@4507 = ~How exactly did you discover this?~
@4508 = ~I spoke to him alone. He asked me to hand you over to him, but I won't do it.~
@4509 = ~I have my ways.~
@4510 = ~Who cares? Let's just make him pay for it.~
@4511 = ~And this "Lord and Lady Burnheart", they are his companions? They were complicit in this deception?~
@4512 = ~One of them is a mage. He disguised them with illusion magic to resemble relatives of yours.~
@4513 = ~Seems like that part was Sigurd's idea, but they certainly went along with it.~
@4514 = ~I got the impression they'd rather have just killed you, but yes.~
@4515 = ~And now they would have me submit to it forever. Discard my very identity, my very *soul*, and yield to this fabricated tale of a human family.~
@4516 = ~There is only one thing I need to know. Where are they now?~
@4517 = ~He said they'd be waiting at Baldur's Gate.~
@4518 = ~Does it really matter, Flara?~
@4519 = ~Then we go. We should have been going before this conversation began. Why did you not tell me on the move? Go. Go now. I will see this matter settled.~
@4520 = ~WHERE ARE THEY NOW?~
@4521 = ~Baldur's Gate.~
@4522 = ~Just drop it. I told you this so you'd know what happened to you, not so we could go chasing revenge.~
@4523 = ~Find out. Let other obligations wait. All of them. I do not care. I do not care if the whole world will burn to ash in your neglect. FIND OUT.~
@4524 = ~Shut up. Shut up. Take me to them, <CHARNAME>, or I will leave and find them myself. Those are your options. I will not negotiate. You will not talk me into a concession. One way or another, they will pay this debt. Choose.~
@4525 = ~They're at Baldur's Gate.~
@4526 = ~Leave, then. I wash my hands of this.~
@4527 = ~Perhaps Sigurd was in the right. He said you were a menace, and I'm starting to believe it. Maybe I should finish what he started.~
@4528 = ~You know what? I'm sick of you acting like you give the orders here. I think it's time I put you in your place.~
@4529 = ~If you had no intention of taking me to Sigurd, you should have kept quiet. You knew, <CHARNAME>. You knew exactly what I would demand of you, you knew I would not take no for an answer, and if you did not know those things then you are more foolish than I ever thought possible.~
@4530 = ~You had me at your side, and now you have cast that boon to the wind. See what your "honour" has earned you.~
@4531 = ~You WORM. You think anyone, any *thing* as low as you could intimidate me? Or do you truly mean to follow through? You should have struck first, insect. It's the only chance you'd have had.~
@4532 = ~Flara, I misspoke. Can we not resolve this without coming to blows? Is there no way we can just continue as we are?~
@4533 = ~I don't want to fight you, Flara, but nor will I be part of your vengeance.~
@4534 = ~I didn't expect to kill my first dragon so soon, but here we are.~
@4535 = ~No. No longer, <CHARNAME>. I will not stand alongside anyone who has threatened me.~
@4536 = ~How unfortunate, then, that you can't have it both ways. I know you now. I know your face, your tactics, your weaknesses. You have the biggest mistake of your pitifully short life.~
@4537 = ~I will find Sigurd, <CHARNAME>. And then I will find you.~
@4538 = ~No! Not like this! I will NOT die like this!~
@4539 = ~As I thought. Unimportant, and not needed at all. Did we not already speak of this, <CHARNAME>? It is too far-fetched, and it grates against my every instinct.~
@4540 = ~But what if you're wrong? Won't you regret burning the bridge?~
@4541 = ~Are you not concerned at all that you may be throwing a good life away?~
@4542 = ~Still, it'd be a nice arrangement. They seemed quite well-to-do, didn't they? You'd want for little.~
@4543 = ~You're going with him, Flara. That's all there is to it.~
@4544 = ~Look, I agree with you. It's too ridiculous to contemplate. But even so, don't you think you'd be better off there than you are here?~
@4545 = ~"What if I'm wrong." That's it? That's how you attempt to sway someone? I have already thought on the matter, <CHARNAME>, and I have concluded that I'm not wrong. That is the process behind forming a belief. Now that you've finally had that explained to you...~
@4546 = ~What life? The daughter of a lord? Aimless puttering through gardens and gatherings, making idle chat with idle peerage, all to peak with a forced marriage to whomever my "father" deems suitable? I gladly throw that away. It is no life at all, compared to what I had.~
@4547 = ~Want for little, except for the one thing I want more than anything else. That is not as good a deal as you imagine.~
@4548 = ~...am I now.~
@4549 = ~And what makes you so insistent all of a sudden? You have no stake in the matter. In fact, my departure would be nothing but detrimental to your own pursuits.~
@4550 = ~Unless, of course, you stood to gain in some other way.~
@4551 = ~I just want to see you reunited with your family. That's all.~
@4552 = ~As always, you overestimate yourself. Getting rid of you would be a relief.~
@4553 = ~Sigurd wanted me to hand you over to him. Let's just say I'm accepting.~
@4554 = ~In what way would I be better off?~
@4555 = ~You saw them as well as I did. They're obviously wealthy people, and nobility to boot. Those are the kind of resources you need, not the bits and baubles we earn from adventuring.~
@4556 = ~Remember the statuette? Maybe they're not family, but they must have some connection to you. You'll find more clues staying close than you will staying away.~
@4557 = ~You just would, Flara. And you're going, whether you want to or not.~
@4558 = ~Oh, just forget it. I'm clearly wasting my breath here.~
@4559 = ~Speak no more of this subject. To even think on it gives me a headache, and your clumsy attempts at persuasion only intensify it.~
@4560 = ~And you thought to earn this sweet, sentimental scene through coercion? No, I do not think that is your motive at all.~
@4561 = ~And yet you never tried to do so. Not until now, when you meet someone who wishes me captured.~
@4562 = ~Yes, suddenly it all comes into focus. What deal did you make with him, <CHARNAME>? What did he offer you? Something most substantial, I hope. Not that you'll ever see it.~
@4563 = ~Is that a threat?~
@4564 = ~What he offered me doesn't matter. You are a threat to innocent life, and I will see you dealt with.~
@4565 = ~What's the problem? You go with them, I get my reward, and you can kill them all when they least expect it. We both win.~
@4566 = ~You're right. I won't. After all, he did want you alive.~
@4567 = ~That is...reasonable enough, I suppose.~
@4568 = ~Then again, it hardly matters if I don't know where to find them. Unless they come searching again, it may well be a moot point.~
@4569 = ~I can take you to them. Sigurd told me to meet him at Baldur's Gate.~
@4570 = ~With everything going on, most of the Coast's nobility will be at Baldur's Gate. That's as good a place to look as any.~
@4571 = ~Perhaps, but keep it in mind if we do run into them again.~
@4572 = ~I could see that from the moment you began. At least you do catch up eventually.~
@4573 = ~Try, then! Try and fail, and regret your idiocy in the Nine Hells!~
@4574 = ~A decent suggestion, <CHARNAME>. If only you'd made it sooner, before I knew you couldn't be trusted.~
@4575 = ~...he told you to meet him?~
@4576 = ~When did he tell you this, precisely? We have encountered him twice thus far, and neither time did he say any such thing. ~
@4577 = ~Oh, he...he mentioned it the second time. Don't you remember?~
@4578 = ~A slip of the tongue. I meant only that Baldur's Gate is the best place to start looking.~
@4579 = ~If you must know, I spoke with him in private.~
@4580 = ~Very well, then. Let us go to Baldur's Gate, and if we should find them there, I...I will consider what you have said.~
@4581 = ~I am not, as they say, holding my breath. Although that does mean something rather different in my case.~
@4582 = ~No. It is a fact.~
@4583 = ~Let me make this clear. As of this moment, Sigurd is my priority. This plot of his...he knows far more of me than he lets on, and I will tear it out of him.~
@4584 = ~Our association ends here. I go now, alone, to seek him out. Do not try to stop me.~
@4585 = ~So be it. Do as you will.~
@4586 = ~Do I have to knock you out first? I'm getting my reward, whatever it takes.~
@4587 = ~I let you leave so you can come back for me later? No. I think I'll nip this in the bud.~
@4588 = ~I do not.~
@4589 = ~A slip, was it? You'll find it a costly one.~
@4590 = ~If I ever see your face again, <CHARNAME>, you will not see mine. Not until it is too late.~
@4591 = ~<CHARNAME>...perhaps it's best if we instate a "no speaking unless spoken to" arrangement. Hmm? Let that feeble mind meander wherever it pleases. Just don't give voice to its travels.~
@4592 = ~Oh, some tavern or other had a "duelling arena." I stopped by just to find out what all the racket was.~
@4593 = ~Honestly, I don't know what you people see in it. Even by the standards of a pit fight, it was boring. A lot of flapping and screeching to little avail.~
@4594 = ~There's nothing to see in it. It's a cruel practice and it should be stopped.~
@4595 = ~I wouldn't know. I've never been to one.~
@4596 = ~I'm not the one to answer that. I've never been fond of them either.~
@4597 = ~It's not about the chickens. It's about the money.~
@4598 = ~More cruel than plucking and roasting them? Rather inconsistent standards you have.~
@4599 = ~Don't. It's a flagrant misuse of both time and food.~
@4600 = ~You lead a more eventful life, I suppose. Once one's spent the day turning soil, anything might seem like entertainment.~
@4601 = ~Perhaps, but there must be less troublesome conduits for gambling. And less malodorous.~
@4602 = ~Absolutely not. But his tenets don't seem entirely out of line with my own. I was curious, if you have to know. And I'm quite sure you don't.~
@4603 = ~If he didn't listen to me, what makes you think you'll fare any better?~
@4604 = ~No, I think more drastic measures are warranted. I'd suggest removing his tongue, teeth and eyes. No talking, no grinning, no leering. Perfect.~
@4605 = ~But then he'd be useless. We'd have to leave him behind.~
@4606 = ~You forgot fingers. I've seen him pinch more than a few times.~
@4607 = ~That's a terrible thing to say!~
@4608 = ~I'll get started on that.~
@4609 = ~As I said, perfect.~
@4610 = ~True, but I imagine the lesson would stick after the first three. Perhaps I'm being optimistic.~
@4611 = ~Is it? I suppose we could just kill him, but I've always favoured poetic vengeance.~
@4612 = ~Be sure and do them in that order. I should like him to know I'm watching.~
@4613 = ~Take it up with him, <CHARNAME>. I was quite happily ignoring him until that insolent remark about trophies.~
@4614 = ~"He started it"? Is that where this is going? I have to mediate squabbling children?~
@4615 = ~That doesn't mean you should escalate it.~
@4616 = ~I'm only asking you because you're more reasonable. He'd likely lose his temper.~
@4617 = ~You don't "have" to do anything. In fact, I'd far prefer you let the matter run its course, so I can teach the demon-suckling whelp his place.~
@4618 = ~Escalate it to what? To the point where we have to find some other brute to take the front? Beat an ogre into submission and be done with it. I don't think they've invented cheek yet.~
@4619 = ~Hmm. Not unwise, but I don't see why you or I should accommodate his tantrums. Be rid of him, if he's that unreliable.~
@4620 = ~Garrick is an atrocious author, an illegible penman, and fetishistically fond of couplets. His very existence degrades the word "bard", a title I held no esteem for to begin with, and expecting him to deliver a decent story was a grave lapse of sanity.~
@4621 = ~Well said!~
@4622 = ~To answer your question, not well.~
@4623 = ~The former. What on earth gave you that impression?~
@4624 = ~Right. I don't know what I was thinking.~
@4625 = ~You're helping her study magic, aren't you?~
@4626 = ~You did sort of compare her to a dragon.~
@4627 = ~See a healer immediately, <CHARNAME>. Mental degeneracy is often progressive.~
@4628 = ~I prefer to have competent lackeys, yes. ~
@4629 = ~Suppositionally. *If* she were a dragon, she would be a brass one. And you would be bronze, if your nosiness is any indication. Kindly mind your own business.~
@4630 = ~Blasted things. The discomfort I can endure, but apparently "you're not supposed to burst them." Do you have ANY idea how maddening that is? And she had the nerve to swat my hand! I tell you, if that poultice of hers hadn't worked, you'd be short one druid.~
@4631 = ~If I recall correctly, yes. What about it?~
@4632 = ~You never struck me as the frolicking type.~
@4633 = ~I'll have to give that a try sometime.~
@4634 = ~That. Is. Adorable.~
@4635 = ~It's not frolicking! It's just...a private moment of contentment. That's all. "Frolicking." Don't be absurd.~
@4636 = ~Concentrate on amassing one big enough first. It's a rather depressing affair otherwise.~
@4637 = ~...be silent.~
@4638 = ~If you mean that I feel sorry for him, I don't. But I can appreciate what drives him. Revenge is a simple thing.~
@4639 = ~There are different words for it, of course. Different perspectives. It comforts some to call it justice, or to imagine they're tipping some cosmic balance by seeking it on behalf of others. But no matter how we frame it, we punish those who wrong us, that they will not do so again. It is shared across all species, and it needs no explanation.~
@4640 = ~It's academic! Obviously I don't want to tap pure chaos for a smattering of coins, but it would be interesting to see the exact amount it creates. The denomination. The rarity of any gemstones that might appear, how finely cut they are... ~
@4641 = ~In case he asks again.~
@4642 = ~I just thought you'd be interested.~
@4643 = ~You learn a lot of useless facts growing up in a library.~
@4644 = ~If he asks again, they'll be his last words. A poor note to end on. Fitting, though. ~
@4645 = ~And I can't very well blame you for that. You are, however, entirely at fault for deciding to share them.~
@4646 = ~You're a poor eavesdropper, <CHARNAME>. Did I not call it a pointless exercise?~
@4647 = ~But isn't that what you were doing the other night? I thought I heard you counting.~
@4648 = ~Must have been my imagination, then.~
@4649 = ~Gold. I was counting my gold. I had a suspicion some of it had gone missing. Which it hadn't. So that was fine.~
@4650 = ~Counting gold with your eyes closed? That's impressive.~
@4651 = ~You're lying through your teeth.~
@4652 = ~Oh. That makes sense.~
@4653 = ~I am a dragon. I can count gold in my *sleep*.~
@4654 = ~Psh. Ain't gotta be a dragon to do that.~
@4655 = ~How should you know? Were you awake the entire time? And just what do you mean by spying on me in the middle of the night? If I hear of this again, I shall have you carry me a tent.~
@4656 = ~Yes. It does. Perfect sense.~
@4657 = ~It's said that maintaining hope in the face of despair is a sign of strength. If so, what is maintaining pessimism in the face of repeated and decisive victory?~
@4658 = ~He has *chosen* misery, apropos of nothing. And that gives insult to those of us who have actual reason to be miserable. So yes, one could say he bothers me, in the sense that I want to twist his head off.~
@4659 = ~That which has value, <CHARNAME>. Some of us fixate on a rawer sort of value, gems and magic and such, but I can see the merits of a well-made machine, even if I'd never need it myself. Curios, I think the term is.~
@4660 = ~And it has nothing at all to do with the gold trim?~
@4661 = ~I always took you for a hoarder, not a collector.~
@4662 = ~I'm surprised you don't just kill her and take it.~
@4663 = ~That hardly precludes what I just said.~
@4664 = ~I can be both. There will always be gold in the world, but inventions may come and go. Best seize them before they are forgotten.~
@4665 = ~Why so? I'm quite content to wait, provided she spends the meantime shooting my enemies.~
@4666 = ~Yes, and that is precisely the problem. I would sooner accept real enmity over this...this dismissive impudence! I am to be admired or feared or despised, not ridiculed!~
@4667 = ~Just ignore him and he'll go away.~
@4668 = ~Feared? He's an escaped drow. There's probably nothing you could do to him that hasn't already been done.~
@4669 = ~What do you want to be despised for?~
@4670 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. He won't. He'll persist until I acknowledge him, because he has nothing better to do when he isn't stabbing backs.~
@4671 = ~How imperceptive of you. He has two arms and two legs, and that alone is four things that haven't been done to him. Not yet.~
@4672 = ~The weak despise the strong, and the foolish the wise. They despise to be shown what they lack. For my lesser to hate me attests to my supremacy, and I welcome it. Even as they burn.~
@4673 = ~You're leaving *me* behind? Are you expecting fireproof bandits, or are you simply tired of living?~
@4674 = ~You should head somewhere safe in the meantime.~
@4675 = ~Neither. So on second thoughts, let's press on.~
@4676 = ~Nashkel will do, I suppose. You may find me at the inn, provided it meets my standards. The *other* inn, to the northwest.~
@4677 = ~Be quick about it. I'm not some dog for you to tether to a post.~
@4678 = ~I almost thought we'd forged something worthwhile. Are you quite certain you wish to sunder it?~
@4679 = ~I'll meet you back at the Nashkel Inn.~
@4680 = ~Now that you ask, no I don't.~
@4681 = ~Oh, very well. For their sakes, I hope they still have those mutton pies.~
@4682 = ~You should know, I keep count of every hour you make me wait.~
@4683 = ~My apologies. I'm ready to leave when you are.~
@4684 = ~You can stop counting, for now. Let's go.~
@4685 = ~You'll have to count a few more, because I don't need you just yet.~
@4686 = ~Brother Dave! At last, our congregation is whole!~
@4687 = ~But what is this? Interlopers! Speak clear and true, for I will ask only once; who has the audacity to set foot in Talos' halls?!~
@4688 = ~Peons, Stormlord! Feeble and ignorant, but prostrate before the Destroyer, that they may be reforged in His conflagration!~
@4689 = ~How DARE-~
@4690 = ~And also a dragon.~
@4691 = ~So be it! Be seated, ye rabble, and mark well the word of Talos! (Scones are on the table. Help yourselves. But take only one, or you will know no respite from His fury.)~
@4692 = ~Talassans! An evening past, the looming clouds spoke unto your loyal Stormlord, bearing tidings from our Amnish brethren. At this very moment, missionaries from the temple in Athkatla ride the gales o'er the mountains, that they may "bolster our ranks."~
@4693 = ~Tell me, what does it say of them, that they see fit to do this?~
@4694 = ~Cheeky sods think we're half-arsing it!~
@4695 = ~Yes! They call our numbers meagre! Our devotion weak! They accuse us of paying lip service, of tarnishing His glorious name! Faithful, my faithful, will they find proof of their charges?!~
@4696 = ~Like hells they will!~
@4697 = ~Nay! Nay, I say!~
@4698 = ~Then we shall take ACTION, brothers and sisters! I want holy symbols polished! I want every local cowering in their homes, praying for mercy! I want a trail of scorched infidels leading to our door!~
@4699 = ~Yeah!~
@4700 = ~We shall erase all doubt of our zeal, and send these cocksures home to Amn with naught but the piss in their boots!~
@4701 = ~Ugh. Get the kettle on, would you Kelly? My throat's murdering me.~
@4702 = ~Yes sir.~
@4703 = ~Ah?~
@4704 = ~Er...yes, Stormlord! I shall...I shall engulf these helpless leaves in a boiling vortex!~
@4705 = ~Brash to enter our temple, and brasher still to approach its chosen Stormlord! You would be but soot on the floorboards, had Brother Dave not stayed my thunder! Speak, unbeliever, but know that Talos hears your every word!~
@4706 = ~This is the temple of Talos? An abandoned cabin in the woods?~
@4707 = ~What's the tabby doing in here?~
@4708 = ~Is it too much to hope you offer healing services?~
@4709 = ~Why do you not? Do you even comprehend your peril? You amble heedless along a dagger's edge!~
@4710 = ~Talos shakes the earth and splits the sky at a whim! The splendour of lightning is His! The howl of the whirlwind and the blaze of wildfire are HIS!  There is NO sanctuary from His rage but a life of prayer and service! To deny Him is madness!~
@4711 = ~And this is his temple? An abandoned cabin in the woods?~
@4712 = ~Fool! The garish cathedrals of lesser faiths are an affront to Talos! Such hubris invites ruination! ~
@4713 = ~Too bloody right! Have you seen the one near Beregost? They spent their alms building that eyesore, then held out their bowls for more! The nerve!~
@4714 = ~That we must scatter the gibberling hordes to reach our holy ground is testament to our might!~
@4715 = ~Yeah! Killed three of the blighters to get here, I did!~
@4716 = ~That is Thundercat. Tempt not her wrath, for it is dire and unyielding.~
@4717 = ~She hungers! Fetch the kippers!~
@4718 = ~Ahh. Behind all great men, a woman.~
@4719 = ~Healing services?! Talos' faithful are no peddlers of curatives! This insult must be answered with death!~
@4720 = ~But hark! I hear His voice on the winds. Rejoice, worm, for your brazenness has pleased Talos! This once, He shall provide! Coin only, please.~
@4721 = ~H-hello there. Welcome to...*ahem*~
@4722 = ~Hail, you...you peons! Welcome to the temple of...of Talos. (Oh dear, that was terrible...)~
@4723 = ~You're a Talassan as well?~
@4724 = ~You seem distressed. Are you here against your will?~
@4725 = ~Oh, er...not quite. I just make the tea and clean up. No lightning bolts for me, not yet.~
@4726 = ~I baked the scones, too. Did you like them?~
@4727 = ~They're delicious.~
@4728 = ~I haven't tried one yet.~
@4729 = ~I've had better.~
@4730 = ~Distressed? No, just nervous. I...I know don't quite fit in yet. Jeff says I need to get in touch with my inner aggression before I'm ready for priesthood. But, um...apart from that...~
@4731 = ~Enunciate, Kelly! Heralds of destruction do not mumble!~
@4732 = ~Y-Yes, Stormlord!~
@4733 = ~Everyone's been so welcoming. And Stormlord Jeff's teaching me to stand up for myself. I let people have their way much too often, and it's time that stopped. So no, I'm quite glad to be here.~
@4734 = ~So you're a Talassan as well?~
@4735 = ~Thank you! It was Dave's idea, but I'm glad I listened. They've gone down a treat.~
@4736 = ~Just a little something to draw the crowd. It's easier to preach indoors. You don't have to shout so loud.~
@4737 = ~Let me know what you think, won't you? But if you don't like them, you can blame Dave. It was his idea.~
@4738 = ~Oh. Well...you can blame Dave, then. It was his idea.~
@4739 = ~(Walk fearless in the storm. Walk *fearless* in the storm. Walk...)~
@4740 = ~I can't believe Stormlord Jeff is dead. This is awful...~
@4741 = ~I have no idea why I was so shy about all this. Once you let yourself go, it's so easy!~
@4742 = ~Cower before me, infidels, or lightning WILL strike twice! ~
@4743 = ~Back off.~
@4744 = ~Oi, oi! Mind where you're walking there. Any further and you'll be in gnoll territory.~
@4745 = ~Then further we go! HAIRY BUTTS SHALL CLENCH IN FEAR OF MINSC'S BOOT!~
@4746 = ~Pardon...?~
@4747 = ~You did not hear? I spoke very loudly, I thought.~
@4748 = ~Thanks for the warning.~
@4749 = ~So what? I can handle a few hyenas.~
@4750 = ~I know. It won't be gnoll territory for long, though.~
@4751 = ~Oh. In that case, I'll steer clear.~
@4752 = ~That's nice. Goodbye.~
@4753 = ~It's as much for my sake as yours, tell you the truth. If they take you prisoner, that's more for me to rescue.~
@4754 = ~Then we're here for the same reason.~
@4755 = ~If anyone will need rescuing, it's them.~
@4756 = ~I'll make sure to stay out of the way.~
@4757 = ~It ain't "a few hyenas." They got a whole fortress up ahead. Dozens of 'em, maybe hundreds. Mind you, not so many since I showed up.~
@4758 = ~Then it sounds like I'm exactly where I need to be.~
@4759 = ~Oh. In that case, I'll steer clear. ~
@4760 = ~Wait. You're looking for the fortress, then? You're attacking?~
@4761 = ~Yes. A friend of Minsc here was taken captive.~
@4762 = ~What's it to you?~
@4763 = ~I am now.~
@4764 = ~What kind of adventurer would I be if I let such beasts run amok?~
@4765 = ~Righto. Safe travels.~
@4766 = ~Don't say you weren't warned.~
@4767 = ~Let me come with you. I've been trying to stick it to those scumbags for a good while, but I can't storm the place alone. Best I can do is pick 'em off here and there, keep 'em worried.~
@4768 = ~I can show you the quickest way, too. Be there before you know it.~
@4769 = ~Why? What's your stake in this?~
@4770 = ~I'd need to know who you are first.~
@4771 = ~I think I'd rather handle this myself.~
@4772 = ~They have prisoners. And you don't want to know the things gnolls do to prisoners. If they're in there too long, there won't be much left to save.~
@4773 = ~Littlun. Littlun Plunkett. Ain't nobody important. Just a girl with a crossbow trying to do what's right.~
@4774 = ~Good enough for me. Welcome aboard.~
@4775 = ~You and your crossbow had better be up to the task. Let's go.~
@4776 = ~Fair enough. Suppose I can't force my help on you. Give 'em one for me, yeah?~
@4777 = ~Hello again. Are you lost or something?~
@4778 = ~What exactly are you doing out here?~
@4779 = ~Where did you say these gnolls were? I have some work to do.~
@4780 = ~No, just going back the way I came. Goodbye.~
@4781 = ~Catching my breath, mostly. Remember I said there were gnolls ahead? I annoyed 'em enough that they sent a patrol after me.~
@4782 = ~'Course, none of them had bows. Bit of patience, bit of hit and run, I got 'em all down. And now there's a trail of dead leading back, so it's easier to find my way. I call that a win.~
@4783 = ~Good for you. Farewell, then.~
@4784 = ~Changed your mind? I'm ready and waiting to spike some hyenas. Just say the word.~
@4785 = ~Maybe I could use you after all. Come with me.~
@4786 = ~No, I'm just regrouping out here. I can manage.~
@4787 = ~Right. And not to be pushy, but this is urgent. If you start dragging your feet, I ain't staying.~
@4788 = ~You set WHAT loose in the woods?! Do you have any idea of the damage they'll do?!~
@4789 = ~Wizards have to be smart, yeah? All them books, all that studying. So how come I wouldn't trust half of 'em to put their socks on before their boots?~
@4790 = ~Could be they're fools, or it could be they know to leave well alone.~
@4791 = ~Gods, that's the most horrible thing I can think of. Did he have kids too?~
@4792 = ~Indeed, madam, indeed he did! Two hale and hearty sons, their young lives CUT SHORT! Twice and thrice did the foul doppelgangers take the faces of Kiel Trollkiller and his brother Fuernebol! Again and again, Durlag was FORCED to meet his beloved children's eyes as he cut them down! Truly a TRAGEDY beyond reckoning!~
@4793 = ~Oh, get over yourself! I spent my entire life in the woods, and I'll wager I know better than you how to respect 'em! I don't need your permission to come home!~
@4794 = ~Aye, you've the bearing of forest folk, but the weapon you wield tells a different story! It is the product of war and of sport-hunting, and it has no place here! I ask again; why should I let you and your foul device go unimpeded?~
@4795 = ~Leave her be, <CHARNAME>! Whatever's going on here, this ain't helping!~
@4796 = ~Gawwwd. I wish I had it in me to let what happens happen. Teach people not to meddle with flamin' basilisks, of all things, just for something to put in a cage and gawp at.~
@4797 = ~Do it, Plunkett. This isn't your problem. Listen to your inner Vynd and walk away.~
@4798 = ~If I had an "inner Vynd", I'd do the opposite of everything it said on principle.~
@4799 = ~She's telling the truth. Sirines wouldn't be caught dead in some docker's house.~
@4800 = ~...that might have been a bad choice of words.~
@4801 = ~Who the hells let him in here? One minute the whole city's barricaded against bandits, the next they're inviting ogres in for a bevvy?~
@4802 = ~I am shocked, Plunkett, *shocked* by your prejudice. Clearly the good people of this city, unlike you, can see that not all ogres are violent brutes.~
@4803 = ~He's trying to kill us, you knobhead.~
@4804 = ~Pfft. Spend a tenday as a halfling named Littlun, then come back to me with that temper.~
@4805 = ~Gods save us. Can't anyone just ask for a favour like a normal person?~
@4806 = ~He's lonely and bored. Just grit your teeth and pretend it's a smile.~
@4807 = ~You'll soon have that in common.~
@4808 = ~'Course we will. By the way, there's a chance your uncle will have some bruises when you next see him. He'll have fallen down some stairs.~
@4809 = ~Your niece is out on the streets, alone, and you're sitting on your useless arse, griping about her cat? GO AND LOOK FOR HER!~
@4810 = ~Pah, let her slum it. I drag her home, she's out the door again the second I turn my back. I'm done with that game.~
@4811 = ~And I suppose you've never once thought about why she started playing it. Out of the way, you sewer nugget. I've got a cat to find.~
@4812 = ~You sit here in your nice warm house while your niece wanders the streets, and then you ask us to kill her pet? Give me one good reason I shouldn't pulverise you.~
@4813 = ~You lay one finger on me and the Flaming Fist will-~
@4814 = ~Throw me in a cell, yeah. *After* I'm done. The only thing they'll do for you is scrape you off the floorboards.~
@4815 = ~I'm going to see about this cat. Hide somewhere until I leave, because I doubt I can look at your face again without breaking it.~
@4816 = ~Don't touch it! It's cursed!~
@4817 = ~Long story. All you need to know is that if you accept that "gift", you'll be trapped here forever. *Some* might say you deserve that, surly bastard that you are. I don't.~
@4818 = ~Ah, there's the catch, and there too is my good sense returned! Trust is death in this business. You almost made me forget that. Too bad your friend has some integrity, isn't it?~
@4819 = ~Two-faced scum. If you come this way again, I'll cut your throat.~
@4820 = ~Good lad. Just mind what you pick. Berries ain't all for eating.~
@4821 = ~We smell funny...? You must have quite the little nose on you, if you can smell anything but seawater.~
@4822 = ~Lucky you, then. Searching for missing sons is just the kind of thing we do.~
@4823 = ~Ah, he's fine. If he's as green as you say, he probably hoofed it once the real danger came. Probably just too embarrassed to come home.~
@4824 = ~*sigh* All this just for trying to make the world a bit safer. In the daftest way they could, maybe, but they still deserved better.~
@4825 = ~Spider's Bane...I wish we'd never found the wretched thing.~
@4826 = ~I can at least say he didn't suffer. Ankheg attacks...theyre usually over in a few seconds. If that helps at all. Probably not.~
@4827 = ~Hustle, <CHARNAME>! Wolves are one thing, but worgs won't even leave bones to bury! Move, move!~
@4828 = ~Point the way, sister. I'll make 'em see sense, one way or the other.~
@4829 = ~You'll find aid here. I'm going with her, <CHARNAME>. My whole tribe would be lining up to spit on me if I turned my back on this.~
@4830 = ~A trace of compassion at last, or merely a ploy to ingratiate yourself? It is too little too late. I would trust you but for the company you keep.~
@4831 = ~Here we are. Right here. This is what kills nature. Not malice, just common human stupidity.~
@4832 = ~It's a TREE, you bloody idiots! There's nothing in there but sap!~
@4833 = ~For what, <CHARNAME>? Is it just a giggle for you, helping murder an innocent dryad? Or are you actually stupid enough to think treasure grows on trees? Either way, your company's not worth keeping.~
@4834 = ~Oh yeah. We'll get right on that. We'll fish a stinking, bloated corpse out of the sewers and drag it all the way back to your house, you complete stranger. That's the kind of thing we do.~
@4835 = ~We're gonna do it, aren't we.~
@4836 = ~You still don't quite get this, do you?~
@4837 = ~Free the nymph, then hand her over to the skeevy mage. Half of that sounds like a plan.~
@4838 = ~You'd better be joking or boltproof, <CHARNAME>, 'cause if you really go through with this, there'll be all nine hells to pay.~
@4839 = ~I warned you, <CHARNAME>! I won't be a bystander to this! HEY YOU! Get your filthy hands off her!~
@4840 = ~Winter wolf. I dunno about "easy pickings", <CHARNAME>. Half-again as big as a normal wolf, and breath that'd freeze your blood in your veins. What some people won't do for a fancy rug...~
@4841 = ~Not unless he made me.~
@4842 = ~*sigh* Another youth left hardened. Innocence lives shorter and shorter these days.~
@4843 = ~Well settled, <CHARNAME>. I'd have bet my crossbow on that turning nasty.~
@4844 = ~Aye, you've the bearing of forest folk, but the weapon you wield tells a different story! It is the product of civilisation and has no place here! I ask again; why should I let you and your foul device go unimpeded?~
@4845 = ~"Remove." That's a tidy little word for cold-blooded murder.~
@4846 = ~Standing aside and crossing our fingers is the worst thing we can do here. You know that.~
@4847 = ~No! He will come to his senses...he will, if we but leave him in peace!~
@4848 = ~Catch and release? You have seen an ankheg before, yeah?~
@4849 = ~<CHARNAME>, I know times are tough, but bilking a man out of his britches? Are we that sodding desperate?~
@4850 = ~She's twelve at the most. Something ain't right here.~
@4851 = ~That's enough, <CHARNAME>. We weren't given the whole story here, and it'll have to be one hell of a tale before I'll kill a girl this age. ~
@4852 = ~What in the hells is wrong with you?!~
@4853 = ~She was a priestess of Umberlee, Littlun. She deserved it.~
@4854 = ~Is there a problem?~
@4855 = ~We couldn't trust a word she said. She'd have had us the second we turned our backs.~
@4856 = ~Oh, a great deal. Not least of which is my love of watching young girls bleed.~
@4857 = ~She was a CHILD! Whatever else she was, child comes first! It always comes first!~
@4858 = ~Is there a problem? How dare you? You cut down a little girl, then look me in the eye and ask if there's a problem? How DARE you?~
@4859 = ~You don't know that! And if you don't know, you wait and see! When the other option is killing a little girl, you bloody well WAIT AND SEE!~
@4860 = ~You sadistic bastard!~
@4861 = ~Look at her. Look at those young, dead eyes. I hope they haunt you to the end of your days.~
@4862 = ~Hey, you. Before you go. Do you have any children?~
@4863 = ~Do I...what? What sort of question is that?~
@4864 = ~The kind I'll get angry if you don't answer. Do you?~
@4865 = ~No, I-~
@4866 = ~Bastard.~
@4867 = ~Nice shot.~
@4868 = ~I wanted to do that.~
@4869 = ~Was that necessary?~
@4870 = ~I aim best at orphaners. Anyone puts a kid through that, they'd better break my fingers first.~
@4871 = ~Draw faster next time, then.~
@4872 = ~Necessary? Nah. Due? That and ten more.~
@4873 = ~Oi, arsehole! When you get where you're going, tell Talos I've got one for him too.~
@4874 = ~Uh, I don't think you should-~
@4875 = ~*Shut up*, Dave.~
@4876 = ~Psh. If it's a gnoll, I'd *pay* fifty gold to wipe its arse.~
@4877 = ~With the sword, obviously.~
@4878 = ~You've got yourself a deal.~
@4879 = ~For 50 gold that gnoll can wipe his own arse. Hey, did you hear the one about the halfling who climbed into the ale keg to lick up the last drop?~
@4880 = ~I haven't. Why don't you tell me?~
@4881 = ~He drowned.~
@4882 = ~Likewise. Watching and waiting.~
@4883 = ~Serves you bloody well right. Now how fast can you get out of shooting distance? Not fast enough, I reckon.~
@4884 = ~I will not flee a morrrrsel!~
@4885 = ~Right. Here's the plan. We find the cat, get her a new one that looks exactly like it and keep quiet.~
@4886 = ~I-~
@4887 = ~But-~
@4888 = ~We-~
@4889 = ~No. No arguments. We're not telling her her kitty's dead. Can't handle it. Not doing it.~
@4890 = ~Allow me. Kid, your cat is so phenomenally deceased that Kelemvor himself-~
@4891 = ~That's it. I'm adopting you. Tell your mum you'll miss her.~
@4892 = ~Now don't you make her wonder, you hear me? You write to her. Visit now and then. It'll mean the world.~
@4893 = ~Oh, now she just buggers off home? What do we do with the leftovers?~
@4894 = ~Wash 'em, dry 'em, toupee shop.~
@4895 = ~Or! Shave 'em, fry 'em, snack stand.~
@4896 = ~Or-~
@4897 = ~Gods alive, forget I asked.~
@4898 = ~You know what else ain't a small crime? CHILD MURDER.~
@4899 = ~You'd better appreciate me biting my tongue in there, <CHARNAME>, because I damn near bit it off.~
@4900 = ~Gods. Dear gods. Those poor kids...~
@4901 = ~You're shaking.~
@4902 = ~Believe me, I'd have gutted him myself if we didn't need him.~
@4903 = ~He was pleasant enough, I thought. Shame he had to leave so quickly.~
@4904 = ~I know I am. I'm surprised I ain't crying. I want to, but nothing's coming. Just hate.~
@4905 = ~Gutting's too quick. *Anything* is too quick. That vicious bastard. No death is slow enough.~
@4906 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am going to take this out on *someone* to<DAYNIGHT>. If you don't want it to be you, stow the wisecracks.~
@4907 = ~Don't you forget him. Never forget. We've spent so long fighting giant, earthshaking monsters, it'd be easy to lose sight of the grubby little ones that hide in the dark.~
@4908 = ~Vynd, what are you doing?~
@4909 = ~Scalping.~
@4910 = ~We ain't getting paid for that anymore. Remember?~
@4911 = ~Yeah. It's just...kinda fun, turns out. Like peeling a giant scab, but without the gangrene.~
@4912 = ~I'm going to be sick and it's your fault.~
@4913 = ~Where's the rest of the prisoners? I know they had more.~
@4914 = ~No longer. I am sorry, but those besides myself have been killed. For sport or for...sustenance.~
@4915 = ~No. No, come on. Not after all that. Gnolls don't just kill their prisoners. They hurt them, they make slaves out of 'em, but they don't...~
@4916 = ~For gods' sakes, we beat them all! We won! There has to be someone!~
@4917 = ~As I said, I am sorry. Would that I could tell thee different. Didst the beasts capture someone thou cared for, then?~
@4918 = ~No. I mean, no-one I knew. I just wanted to help...~
@4919 = ~Thou hast my gratitude, for what little it might comfort thee. And my service as a mage as well, shouldst thou will it so.~
@4920 = ~No. No, come on. Not after all that. Gnolls don't just kill their captives. They hurt them, they make slaves out of 'em, but they don't...~
@4921 = ~Now hold on just a bloody minute! I've been busting my arse to try and save the prisoners here, and now you want me to kill the only one that survived? Just because this red streak of piss says so?~
@4922 = ~If you're with him, <CHARNAME>, you're against me. End of story.~
@4923 = ~Well then. Sorry Edwin. I'm not about to argue with a loaded crossbow.~
@4924 = ~An apt choice of words, halfling! Your story ends here!~
@4925 = ~Now hold on just a bloody minute! I've been busting my arse to try and save the prisoners here, and now you want me to stand by and let this red streak of piss kill the only survivor?~
@4926 = ~Right. There's a bridge up ahead, and a pair of ogrillons who think they own it. They're about as smart as they sound. I usually just slip past 'em, but if you ain't up to that...~
@4927 = ~I am. They'll never know we're here.~
@4928 = ~Maybe we can talk our way past.~
@4929 = ~Violence it is.~
@4930 = ~Good. It's the gnolls we have to worry about anyway. Nobody in their right mind would want to cross this bridge in the first place.~
@4931 = ~Present company included, most likely.~
@4932 = ~You can try, but they'll be asking for gold. If you start talking, the only thing they'll understand is that you ain't giving 'em any.~
@4933 = ~*sigh* I'd rather not, but if they attack, they attack. At least let's make it quick.~
@4934 = ~<CHARNAME>, I came with you because you said you were storming the gnoll fortress. That's it. If you're gonna start mucking about, I'm gone. Those prisoners need help. Now.~
@4935 = ~Listen. Thanks for the help. I owe you. If you need it, there's a crossbow with a good pair of eyes behind it right here.~
@4936 = ~Are you alright?~
@4937 = ~Your skills would be welcome.~
@4938 = ~I think it's best if we part ways.~
@4939 = ~Yeah. No. I just...I thought there'd be one or two gone, not one or two *left*. And there wouldn't even be that many if you hadn't come along. Some bloody help I was.~
@4940 = ~I don't want to think about it right now. I just need to get out of here. Am I going with you or not?~
@4941 = ~Yeah. Thank gods they're welcome somewhere.~
@4942 = ~Take care of yourself, then. You did a good thing here. Remember that.~
@4943 = ~So what's your story, then? I was so hell-bent on that fortress, I never even wondered about you.~
@4944 = ~I'm looking for the man who killed my foster father.~
@4945 = ~There's no story. I left home recently and I'm just trying to survive.~
@4946 = ~You want my story? Wait a few years, then ask any bard in Faerun.~
@4947 = ~Don't bother. You're here to fight, not to talk.~
@4948 = ~Oh. Oh, gods. I'm sorry. When was this?~
@4949 = ~Not long ago. I still miss him terribly.~
@4950 = ~I can hardly remember. Everything since has been a blur.~
@4951 = ~Don't be sorry. I didn't care for him much, but it must be answered for, even so.~
@4952 = ~I could say the same, now them gnolls got what they deserved. I didn't really think about what comes next.~
@4953 = ~Planning to make a name for yourself? I'd mind saying things like that then, or people'll be asking the scholars instead of the bards. "Just how did one <PRO_MANWOMAN> get so far up <PRO_HISHER> own arse?"~
@4954 = ~I can't imagine. I've lost friends before, but family...well. Ain't really got one, as such.~
@4955 = ~Recently, then. I'm sorry. Really.~
@4956 = ~That's...fair, I suppose. I didn't know the bloke, so it ain't for me to say.~
@4957 = ~Would've been smarter to ask *before* saying I'd come with you, but I ain't been leaning towards smart decisions lately. Why break the streak?~
@4958 = ~You can still leave if you want. I don't consider you obligated.~
@4959 = ~You mean your decision to fight all those gnolls by yourself?~
@4960 = ~Is that self-deprecation, or are you really asking?~
@4961 = ~I do. And even if I didn't, it ain't like I got somewhere else to be.~
@4962 = ~Partly that. Partly some other things.~
@4963 = ~Bit of both, I suppose.~
@4964 = ~I ain't your usual down-home village halfling, if the tattoos didn't give it away. I was raised by elves, out in the forest. Wild elves. A tribe took me in after my dad died.~
@4965 = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@4966 = ~What about your mother?~
@4967 = ~So where'd you get that fancy crossbow? That doesn't look like something a wild elf made.~
@4968 = ~Ah, don't be. I was only a baby, so there's not much to miss. More curious than sad. But this crossbow was his, I know that much.~
@4969 = ~Dunno. She might be dead too, or she might've run off somewhere. I ain't got anything of hers. But I know this crossbow was my dad's.~
@4970 = ~My dad left it to me. Or at least he died with it on him, and the tribe decided it should go to me.~
@4971 = ~Made it himself, he did. And he wrote this manuscript too, or most of it. See this bit? This is all quotes from people saying how brilliant he was. "A leading authority, masterful bowyer, blah de blah."~
@4972 = ~He must have been a great man.~
@4973 = ~Sounds like a pompous ass to me.~
@4974 = ~Gosh, how incredibly interesting.~
@4975 = ~He certainly thought he was, the way he wrote. But he knew his stuff, and he did more with his life than most people. Dunno if that makes you great, but it's a start.~
@4976 = ~Just a bit. But one look at his work and you know it's not just hot air. ~
@4977 = ~And this part here's about the origins of the crossbow. It started out as the ballista, but then along came trebuchets, which are better for handling walls. More force behind 'em, you see. But they didn't have the accuracy, so...~
@4978 = ~*yawn*~
@4979 = ~Anyway. I left the tribe, not that you hadn't guessed. And I ain't sure I should've. But something came of it, thanks to you, so I might as well stay the course, eh?~
@4980 = ~Oh, and here's all about different kinds of ammunition. The wood elves invented arrows with special holes carved in so they make bird calls when you shoot 'em. No good if you want to hit anything, though. They wobble all over the place. He reckons they were just showing off, because we already had bird whistles. Why bother?~
@4981 = ~*YAAAAAWN*~
@4982 = ~Oh goodness, am I boring you? That's what you get, you sarky git. I've a good mind to make you sit and read the whole thing.~
@4983 = ~Whereabouts are you from, <CHARNAME>? If you don't mind saying.~
@4984 = ~I spent most of my life in Candlekeep.~
@4985 = ~Why do you ask?~
@4986 = ~I do mind saying. If I have to talk about my past one more time, I'll vomit. Leave me in peace.~
@4987 = ~The book tower? I remember seeing it from the Cloakwood once. Looked a bit ominous to me, but then so does anything bigger than a log cabin.~
@4988 = ~Book tower? The word you're looking for is "library."~
@4989 = ~The people are welcoming, even if the gates aren't.~
@4990 = ~It's anything but ominous on the inside. Farmers, doddering monks and guards who've never seen a real fight in their lives.~
@4991 = ~It's a big question. The place you grew up changes you more than anything else. Look at me. You think I'd be the way I am if I was raised in some cosy halfling homestead?~
@4992 = ~It paints a different picture, certainly.~
@4993 = ~Don't put too much weight on it. Ordinary places can breed extraordinary people.~
@4994 = ~That's not what I believe. People are what they are, no matter where they came from.~
@4995 = ~I know what a sodding library is, cheers. But most libraries don't have ramparts. Yeah, I know what those are too.~
@4996 = ~Have to say, I wouldn't expect a place like that to put out a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN>. At least, not one who's any good.~
@4997 = ~Strange, though. Even growing up in a place like that, you're just at home in the woods as I am. Must have sneaked out a lot. Or I just don't give book smarts enough credit.~
@4998 = ~Still. All those monks around, it's no wonder you became a holy <PRO_MANWOMAN> yourself.~
@4999 = ~You must have been bored out of your mind to pick up the skills you did. Can't imagine there was much worth nicking in there.~
@5000 = ~I suppose it makes sense, you being magically inclined. I'd be surprised if anyone raised there didn't know a cantrip or two.~
@5001 = ~I did think it was strange. You didn't strike me as a worldly sort...no offence...but you seem to know a bit about everything anyway. Suddenly it's all clear.~
@5002 = ~Better than the other way round, eh? ~
@5003 = ~Sounds dull, then. But in a good way, if that makes sense.~
@5004 = ~Exactly. Quiet, domestic life. Housework. Taxes. Gives me chills to think about, but so would living by a campfire and shooting gnolls if I weren't used to it.~
@5005 = ~Yeah, but if most people were extraordinary then "extraordinary" wouldn't mean anything, would it?~
@5006 = ~I ain't saying we're not our own people. Gods know it'd take a miracle to smooth my edges. Just that everyone carries a bit of home with 'em.~
@5007 = ~You ever plan to go back there? Or did you decide it was time to move on?~
@5008 = ~I'd go right now, if only they'd allow it.~
@5009 = ~I'm not sure, but the decision's been made for me regardless.~
@5010 = ~It was too stifling. I wouldn't return even if I could.~
@5011 = ~Anyway, you didn't answer me. Or would you rather not?~
@5012 = ~That's right. I'd rather not. If I have to talk about my past one more time, I'll vomit. Leave me in peace.~
@5013 = ~What do you mean? They won't let you in again?~
@5014 = ~Nobody's allowed into Candlekeep unless they "donate a tome of great value." One per visit.~
@5015 = ~No, but it doesn't matter. I'm ready to move on.~
@5016 = ~It's a moot point. I've got too much to deal with right now to even consider going home.~
@5017 = ~Yeah, leaving the nest's all fine and dandy. But knowing the nest's still there if you need it...that's important.~
@5018 = ~Well sod that. Just tell 'em you live there. They must know your face, yeah?~
@5019 = ~I've tried, but the warden is adamant. Those are the rules.~
@5020 = ~Oh, they know it damn well. But believe me, the warden wouldn't care.~
@5021 = ~I'm not going to kick up a fuss. It's time I moved on from there anyway.~
@5022 = ~It's a moot point. I've got too much to deal with right now to even think about going home.~
@5023 = ~Can't fault you there. There's definitely such a thing as thinking too far ahead.~
@5024 = ~Looks like we're sharing a boat, at any rate. Wild elves never stay put, and they're bloody good at not leaving a trail. I've been away long enough that I wouldn't know where to find 'em anymore.~
@5025 = ~I knew when I left, it'd be for good.~
@5026 = ~Why did you leave, then?~
@5027 = ~It sounds like you parted on bad terms.~
@5028 = ~Donate him a good wallop, then! Where is this place? I'll go and put my boot up 'em for you. Never heard such a load of rubbish in my life.~
@5029 = ~It's just their way, Littlun. If they make an exception for me, everyone else will expect the same.~
@5030 = ~Finally someone else says it!~
@5031 = ~It's fine. Once I had the chance to think about it, I realised I never really wanted to go back.~
@5032 = ~'Cause I'm stupid.~
@5033 = ~Sometimes. Sometimes not.~
@5034 = ~Worse than I'd have liked, yeah.~
@5035 = ~We'll have to go book-hunting. Get you a nice heavy one. Then he'll know when you belt him in the face with it.~
@5036 = ~I'll tell you about it another time, maybe. Been gabbing long enough for now.~
@5037 = ~Bleh.~
@5038 = ~Bleh yourself.~
@5039 = ~Please be quiet.~
@5040 = ~It's these radishes. I got 'em from town, just to nibble on, but they taste wrong. Bland.~
@5041 = ~Back with the tribe, there were wild forest radishes we used to harvest. Brownbuds, they're called. Had this lovely spicy flavour to 'em. And for a snack, we'd slice 'em up raw with whole smoked pilchards...oh. Bliss. Crunchy bliss.~
@5042 = ~I'd like to try that someday.~
@5043 = ~To each their own, I suppose.~
@5044 = ~That sounds revolting.~
@5045 = ~I'll make it for you. Ain't complicated, if you can find the ingredients.~
@5046 = ~Let veg be veg, I say. Can't understand why all these taverns take perfectly good grub and boil it to mush.~
@5047 = ~It's the fish, right? Some people turn their nose up at anything with the eyes still in. Ah well. More for the rest of us.~
@5048 = ~Maybe not the fanciest fare in the world, but it's childhood food. Food for the heart. Sometimes...sometimes that's all you're really hungry for.~
@5049 = ~...did you still want to hear how I left home? ~
@5050 = ~It sounds like you need to talk about it.~
@5051 = ~If you don't mind.~
@5052 = ~Oh no. I know the start of a sob story when I hear it. Tell it to someone else. ~
@5053 = ~Yeah, you might be right. I've barely spoken to anyone since. Not had the chance. Couldn't hurt to get it off my chest.~
@5054 = ~It happened in the Wealdath. "Forest of Tethir", you probably call it. Me and a few scouts were keeping an eye on this caravan passing through. Calishites, judging by their skin. But they had this "guide" up front, and I dunno if he was drunk or just daft, but every single bloody word out of his mouth was wrong.~
@5055 = ~Kept saying "this way" and pointing, and somehow he always pointed away from where they should have been going and towards us. It was uncanny. And if we'd let it go on, they'd have bungled straight into our encampment.~
@5056 = ~Now if there's one thing wild elves don't like, it's outsiders, Anyone gets too close to the tribe, they capture 'em, wipe their memories and set 'em loose near the edge of the forest. Somewhere they can find their way.~
@5057 = ~And it so happens these lot found their way into a pack of gnolls.~
@5058 = ~So you went after them?~
@5059 = ~There's a rotten bit of luck.~
@5060 = ~That sounds like their problem, not yours.~
@5061 = ~We should've checked it was safe first. It was our fault, and I told 'em that. Told 'em we had to take responsibility. But the elders said it'd cost too many elven lives, chasing 'em down. And I said, "I'll go by myself, then, and it won't cost any."~
@5062 = ~Only...not just as calm as that.~
@5063 = ~And what did they say?~
@5064 = ~You should be proud of your integrity.~
@5065 = ~How could they be so cold?~
@5066 = ~All this for some strangers you'd never see again anyway?~
@5067 = ~Not a dickybird. Just let me walk away.~
@5068 = ~Tch. Surprised at my stubbornness, more like.~
@5069 = ~The elders have to put the tribe first, and gnolls had already cost us plenty. We've have lost more than we saved. Wasn't coldness, just sense. But it took me a while to realise that.~
@5070 = ~They were people, <CHARNAME>. People who'd done us no harm. Only the worst kind of bastard deserves to be gnoll meat.~
@5071 = ~So I tracked them and tracked them all the way back to that fortress of theirs. By the time I'd cooled down, started wondering if it was worth it, it was too late to change my mind. Least that's what I told myself.~
@5072 = ~All that for one sodding prisoner.~
@5073 = ~Uh. No offence, Dynaheir.~
@5074 = ~None intended, none taken.~
@5075 = ~"One sodding prisoner" is still a life, Littlun. Don't undervalue it.~
@5076 = ~It does seem like a waste.~
@5077 = ~That is kind of funny.~
@5078 = ~I know. But I still see those pits in my sleep. I still remember poor Dynaheir trussed up on a pile of dead. Every time I feel like I did right, start feeling proud of myself, those pits come and take it away.~
@5079 = ~It feels like it. I know it's not, deep down. There's not much I wouldn't give to save a life, even one, but I still see those pits in my sleep. I still remember poor Dynaheir trussed up on a pile of dead. Every time I feel like I did right, start feeling proud of myself, those pits come and take it away.~
@5080 = ~Funny? I'm glad it's making *someone* happy, 'cause I ain't laughing. I still see those pits in my sleep. I still remember poor Dynaheir trussed up on a pile of dead. Every time I feel like I did right, start feeling proud of myself, those pits come and take it away.~
@5081 = ~You can have these, if you want. My appetite's gone.~
@5082 = ~Gods above, this is dire.~
@5083 = ~We'll get through it. Just don't let your guard down.~
@5084 = ~You assaulted a fortress alone, but this is too much for you?~
@5085 = ~This is *nothing*. There were supposed to be demons down here. I'm disappointed.~
@5086 = ~I ain't talking about the fighting. Just this. The mine. I feel like I'm breathing through a dirty rag.~
@5087 = ~How can people do this? Crawl into a dark, stuffy hole and clobber the walls for hours. Same slog, every day. All for a handful of copper that's only worth anything because people say so. How does that not drive you mad?~
@5088 = ~Sometimes it does. Sometimes you don't even notice.~
@5089 = ~It's a dreary life, no doubt. But some people don't have a choice.~
@5090 = ~I didn't think you'd be so afraid of hard work.~
@5091 = ~This is why I'm on the road. Either I'll make my own way or I'll die, but I'll never end up like this.~
@5092 = ~No, they *think* they don't have a choice. That's the problem with cities. They make you feel like you can't live without 'em.~
@5093 = ~Who's afraid of work? Living off the land takes work. Yeah, sometimes hard work. But it's *better*. Don't grind you down the way this does. Don't stifle you.~
@5094 = ~I'd love to take these poor sods away from their paved roads and their markets and teach 'em to live wild. Just for a month or two. Just to give their minds some space.~
@5095 = ~I agree in theory, but humankind and "civilisation" are seldom easily parted.~
@5096 = ~That's a worthy cause. Maybe it's something for you to pursue if we should part ways.~
@5097 = ~Somehow I don't see them jumping at the chance.~
@5098 = ~Why do you care so much?~
@5099 = ~One problem at a time. Let's stop them getting killed first.~
@5100 = ~Yeah, perhaps. I can hardly just walk up and say "Oi, I'm off for a jaunt in the Cloakwood, who wants to come?" But there's gotta be some way. Hate seeing people miserable like this.~
@5101 = ~Why shouldn't I? People are miserable and they don't have to be. There'd be a lot less of that if we'd stop being afraid to reach out.~
@5102 = ~Right, sorry. Getting ahead of myself. I just hate seeing people miserable like this.~
@5103 = ~Exactly. Sometimes surviving ain't good enough. You have to live too.~
@5104 = ~<CHARNAME>. Listen. I ain't staying by your side forever, most likely. Sooner or later I'll feel like I've paid you back, and sooner or later you'll be going one way and I'll be going the other.~
@5105 = ~But if you're ever up against a bastard like him again, someone who makes pack animals out of people, you come find me and we'll show 'em what's what. That's my promise to you.~
@5106 = ~Careful. I might hold you to that.~
@5107 = ~And you thought Nashkel was bad.~
@5108 = ~Why part ways, then? Let's just cut the middleman and hunt slavers.~
@5109 = ~Might? You'd damn well better.~
@5110 = ~I know. Now I'm scaring myself with how much worse it might get.~
@5111 = ~You joke, but I'd be more than happy doing that for a living.~
@5112 = ~It ain't much different from what gnolls do, thinking about it. But it's easy to look at gnolls and say they ain't "us." They're just monsters. "We" wouldn't get on like that.~
@5113 = ~What a bloody mess.~
@5114 = ~At least we're here to clean it up.~
@5115 = ~Once we find the people at the top, we can make some messes of our own.~
@5116 = ~This is what the world's like, Littlun. Sorry I had to introduce it to you.~
@5117 = ~Thank gods someone is.~
@5118 = ~You'll not find me lacking. I ain't the tidiest person at the best of times.~
@5119 = ~Don't be smug. I ain't some mollycoddled milksop. It's just different, being in the thick of it like this.~
@5120 = ~Let's go. I don't want to look at this place anymore.~
@5121 = ~Hell and Gehenna, this is bloody *massive*.~
@5122 = ~Look at the ground! It's all cobbles! All of it! That must've taken ages!~
@5123 = ~You've never been in a city before?~
@5124 = ~Having second thoughts about life in the forest?~
@5125 = ~All the sights in Baldur's Gate and you're impressed with the pavement.~
@5126 = ~Gods, I used to think Beregost was a city. You spend your life in tents, it's hard to imagine people taking the time to build this much.~
@5127 = ~No. Right away I can tell I wouldn't get used to this, but it's still amazing. Just to look at. ~
@5128 = ~Don't take the mick. I'm working my way up, alright?~
@5129 = ~I've always wanted to see the great elven cities. Evereska, Leuthilspar, Suldanessellar...course, they're all fool's dreams for a halfling. But this is still something, innit? This is something.~
@5130 = ~It certainly is.~
@5131 = ~Don't settle for second best. I'm sure you can find a way into at least one.~
@5132 = ~I personally think elven architecture is overrated.~
@5133 = ~You'd best lead the way. No trees in sight and my sense of direction's buggered.~
@5134 = ~Heh, maybe if I stick with you I will. You got a knack for getting where you're not supposed to be.~
@5135 = ~Oh, like you're such a bloody expert, Mister "I've Only Just Seen The Outside Of A Library."~
@5136 = ~Oh, like you're such a bloody expert, Miss "I've Only Just Seen The Outside Of A Library."~
@5137 = ~Familiar faces at last, eh? Must be a relief.~
@5138 = ~It is. I was sure I'd never be able to come back.~
@5139 = ~Not when I know the place might be in danger.~
@5140 = ~All I can think about is that I'll have to leave again.~
@5141 = ~Familiar, but not friendly. I've never cared much for any of them.~
@5142 = ~Just goes to show, you can never tell what a little grit'll get you. Gives me a bit of hope, don't it?~
@5143 = ~"Might be." These Iron Throne lot are some right trogs, but I don't reckon they want to raise hell just yet. Not here. ~
@5144 = ~More fool you if you don't enjoy it while you can, then. Don't ruin it for yourself.~
@5145 = ~Oh, come off it. You were with these people before you knew what the word "family" meant. Might get sick of looking at 'em sometimes, but that don't mean you don't care.~
@5146 = ~Maybe...nah. I was going to say maybe you'll get to meet my people someday, but I turn up with a stranger in tow, I'll get the boot along with you.~
@5147 = ~I don't even know what'd happen if I came back alone.~
@5148 = ~I'm sure they'd have you again.~
@5149 = ~There's only one way to find out.~
@5150 = ~Who knows? They might throw you a party.~
@5151 = ~I ain't sure I was ever had. Always appreciate their alone time, the wild elves, but sometimes it felt like they appreciated it more around me.~
@5152 = ~Sometimes you wish you hadn't found out, though. I'd rather think they might miss me than know they didn't.~
@5153 = ~Pfft. My tribe? The Seldarine themselves could pop in for a chat and the most they'd get is a smile and a nod.~
@5154 = ~So small, this place. So closed in. But maybe that makes it easier to feel like you're part of it.~
@5155 = ~I can't believe this. I cannot believe this. I can't believe he's still alive, I can't believe he ran off, I can't believe I LET HIM, I can't believe I...~
@5156 = ~I feel like I made a mess of that.~
@5157 = ~I ain't getting my temper up over nothing. Am I? How would you feel if your dad just popped up one day and said "Oops, sorry <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>, I ain't really dead. Forgot to mention."~
@5158 = ~Considering who my real father was, that would be a memorable experience.~
@5159 = ~I'd be thrilled, actually.~
@5160 = ~I don't know. He's the type of man who'd have his reasons.~
@5161 = ~I'd be livid.~
@5162 = ~I wouldn't feel much of anything.~
@5163 = ~That's not what I...agh, never mind. I ain't thinking straight.~
@5164 = ~...yeah, well. You actually spent time with yours.~
@5165 = ~Yeah, that's the thing. You know that about your dad. I don't.~
@5166 = ~Exactly! 'Course you would. I've got every flamin' right to be angry. ~
@5167 = ~What? But he's...well, fair enough. At least you had the chance to decide you ain't bothered.~
@5168 = ~Feels like a complete waste. The first time I ever met my dad properly, and I shout at him until he scarpers. But then maybe he would have done it anyway. What if he deserved a bollocking and that was my only chance to give him one?~
@5169 = ~*sigh* I want to look for him. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do when I find him.~
@5170 = ~Give him a chance. I'm sure he'll have an explanation.~
@5171 = ~You could always take his legs out first.~
@5172 = ~Just do whatever feels natural.~
@5173 = ~Maybe you should fake your own death. Perfect payback.~
@5174 = ~Yeah, but will it be the truth? He's got time to think of a story now. Still, better some chance than none...~
@5175 = ~Shoot him in the knees and then ask why he left me? Answering my own question there, ain't I?~
@5176 = ~Hah. If I did what felt natural, you'd have to call the bloody guards.~
@5177 = ~...I know you're joking, but the sad thing is, I ain't even sure he'd care.~
@5178 = ~I'll just have to keep quiet next time. If I start ranting before he's said his piece, I need you to stick your hand over my mouth. Gods know it's cost me enough already.~
@5179 = ~<CHARNAME>, I never said thanks for helping me find my dad. So...thanks. You didn't have to do that.~
@5180 = ~I'm sure you could have managed it on your own anyway.~
@5181 = ~It's fine. Just as long as there aren't any other long-lost relatives lurking out there.~
@5182 = ~How are you feeling about it now?~
@5183 = ~Yeah, probably. But you'd have been well within reason to tell me to bugger off and do it on my own time. It means something that you didn't.~
@5184 = ~Hell, if there are, I might just leave 'em to it. I ain't keen to go through that again. Not yet.~
@5185 = ~Still not sure what to think, to be honest. It's nice to know he didn't just put me in a catapult and fling me into the woods, but...~
@5186 = ~"I gave you up because I knew I wouldn't treat you right." Does that make you a good parent or a bad one?~
@5187 = ~A good one. He was trying to give you the best life he could.~
@5188 = ~A bad one. If he really cared, he'd have pulled himself together.~
@5189 = ~Neither. It just makes you a parent.~
@5190 = ~Yeah. At least he left me with people he trusted. If I was just a weight in his arms, he wouldn't have carried me that far.~
@5191 = ~Part of me keeps thinking that, but...even now, when he talked about my mum, I swear his wrinkles faded. Very easy to say "get over it", but I can only imagine what it's like to lose someone you love that much.~
@5192 = ~I suppose. Gods know I'd be panicking if I felt like I might hurt a kid. Probably run to the other end of the world just to make sure I didn't.~
@5193 = ~Oh, thanks. Fat lot of help you are. At least you admit it, instead of talking out your arse.~
@5194 = ~Hardly matters at this point, mind. It's a million to one, me bumping into him like that, so someone above must've been keeping an eye. Halfling or elf, I don't know, but they didn't give me this just so I could let it drop.~
@5195 = ~Besides, whoever he was when I was born, I reckon a couple of dozen years gets you a second chance.~
@5196 = ~I agree. I'm glad you see it that way.~
@5197 = ~You're more forgiving than I'd be.~
@5198 = ~Technically it's his third chance. He ran away the second time.~
@5199 = ~What can I say? For all my thick-hidedness, turns out I'm a bit of a softie.~
@5200 = ~<CHARNAME>. These ain't your friends. Just monsters wearing their faces. But still, if you need to, close your eyes and I'll see 'em off.~
@5201 = ~When I left home, I never really wondered about where I might end up, but if I had...I don't think this would've come to mind.~
@5202 = ~Whatever happens, I'm glad you thought I was worth lugging around all this time.~
@5203 = ~And I'm glad you thought I was worth staying with.~
@5204 = ~Maybe you should go, Littlun. This doesn't have to be your fight.~
@5205 = ~Only just, mind you.~
@5206 = ~You are. And I couldn't just turn my back on all this. Not after I'm this far in. Not after throwing my tribe away.~
@5207 = ~I'll be honest; there's times I've wondered if you were. But I couldn't just turn my back on all this. Not when I'm this far in. Not after throwing my tribe away.~
@5208 = ~Go? I'm here, after all this, after throwing away my tribe, and you're telling me to go? ~
@5209 = ~I'd better try harder, then. I'll be buggered if I threw away my tribe and came all this way just to be someone else's dead weight.~
@5210 = ~I loved those people, you know. Still do. No matter what they thought of me. I'd gift wrap the world for 'em. And now I'll never see them again.~
@5211 = ~So I'm going to do something good. I'm going to make a difference, starting here. And maybe, once I've done enough, I'll feel like it was worth it.~
@5212 = ~<CHARNAME>. Shape up.~
@5213 = ~I'm trying.~
@5214 = ~Oops. Here comes the lecture.~
@5215 = ~You shape up. If you don't like how I do things, leave the party.~
@5216 = ~Don't play innocent.~
@5217 = ~Not hard enough.~
@5218 = ~Nah. Let's keep this short and brutal.~
@5219 = ~Did you mean that, or was it just meant to cow me? If it was the second one, prepare yourself for a shock.~
@5220 = ~I told you I owe you for the gnolls. Maybe you think that'll keep me here, turning a blind eye, but it won't. There is no excuse for these things you're doing, and if you can't show some decency to other people, you don't deserve any from me. I will NOT hold myself in debt to scum.~
@5221 = ~Shape up. Or I'm gone.~
@5222 = ~Disgraceful, <CHARNAME>. Absolutely bloody disgraceful. You make me sick.~
@5223 = ~I'm leaving. I've seen enough. You try and stop me, one word, one move, I swear you'll get a bolt through both eyes.~
@5224 = ~Everything alright?~
@5225 = ~I notice you don't like gnolls much.~
@5226 = ~What do you like to do besides shoot people?~
@5227 = ~Do your tattoos mean anything?~
@5228 = ~Have I mentioned I like short women?~
@5229 = ~If you were raised by elves, how come you don't talk like one?~
@5230 = ~Say something in elven!~
@5231 = ~Could I get a crossbow like yours made?~
@5232 = ~You could probably use a regular bow if you tried, you know.~
@5233 = ~How come you like children so much?~
@5234 = ~Why are the wild elves so insular?~
@5235 = ~Which god do you worship?~
@5236 = ~I'd like to know more about Solonor.~
@5237 = ~Has anyone ever told you you're beautiful?~
@5238 = ~What did you and your father talk about?~
@5239 = ~So what was your mother like?~
@5240 = ~What do you plan to do once this is over?~
@5241 = ~Littlun, Gorion's letter said I'm part of Alaundo's prophecy. I'm one of Bhaal's children.~
@5242 = ~"Shinytits"?~
@5243 = ~Looks like you have more in common with Branwen than you thought.~
@5244 = ~Did it occur to you that a drunken archery contest might be incredibly dangerous?~
@5245 = ~What's going on between you and Dorn?~
@5246 = ~Dynaheir already has a protector, you know.~
@5247 = ~I heard you threatening Edwin.~
@5248 = ~So you think Faldorn's methods are too extreme?~
@5249 = ~Why are you so opposed to guarding caravans?~
@5250 = ~Khalid seems to be picking up elven quickly enough.~
@5251 = ~Greetings, Appleslayer.~
@5252 = ~Talking to Montaron like that won't make him less likely to turn on us.~
@5253 = ~So what did you learn about the aarakocra?~
@5254 = ~It sounds like Rasaad's story inspired you a little.~
@5255 = ~I really don't think Tiax is fixable.~
@5256 = ~Do you think Viconia's telling the truth about the people she killed?~
@5257 = ~I wanted to say congratulations on your marriage. I'm sure Montaron will make a fine husband.~
@5258 = ~Do you think you'll move in with the dwarves or not?~
@5259 = ~I'd have thought you'd be more opposed to travelling with a priest of Talos.~
@5260 = ~What do you make of Flara?~
@5261 = ~I didn't realise juniper had such an effect on you.~
@5262 = ~How do you put up with Vynd?~
@5263 = ~Want a drink, Littlun?~
@5264 = ~Rule of thumb, <CHARNAME>. If I ain't cursing, you needn't worry.~
@5265 = ~Ah, nothing worth panicking over. Rub some dirt in it.~
@5266 = ~Oi, oi! Figure of speech!~
@5267 = ~I've had worse. Just barely, mind.~
@5268 = ~(Seldarine's piss. Son of a poxing succubus. Bastard piece of sh...) Sorry, what?~
@5269 = ~No complaints, <CHARNAME>. There's a lot of badness in the world, and it won't ever be gone altogether, but damned if we ain't putting a dent in it.~
@5270 = ~Alright, I suppose. Feel like there's a case of tunnel vision going on, though. This region's suffering, <CHARNAME>. People like us need to take notice and lend a hand.~
@5271 = ~Honestly? I ain't thrilled with your direction so far. You get things done, I won't deny that, but the way you do 'em...the ends only justify the means when there ain't any better means.~
@5272 = ~I've felt a mite sharper since I found my dad. Been seeing things clearer. I'm starting to think you and I are the only ones who can stop what's coming, and I'm starting to think we just might be up to it.~
@5273 = ~Where'd you get that idea? I love gnolls. Guilt-free target practice.~
@5274 = ~But why gnolls in particular? Some races are just as bad. What about ogres? Goblins? ~
@5275 = ~We'd be a lot better off without them, I must admit.~
@5276 = ~That's a dangerous attitude, Littlun. Don't be blinded by hate.~
@5277 = ~Ogres? There's no words small enough to explain right and wrong to an ogre. Ain't their fault.~
@5278 = ~And goblins...you've never seen a goblin cave, have you? Think of the rattiest, dirtiest slum you can, and there's a goblin's idea of posh living.~
@5279 = ~They're just trying to get a leg up. I'm not saying that excuses 'em, but they've always got a reason. They don't just hurt you for the hell of it. They don't do that.~
@5280 = ~Gnolls ain't stupid and they ain't runts. They know what they're doing and they like it.~
@5281 = ~But there are so many others. Orcs, kobolds, xvarts...~
@5282 = ~What about demons, then?~
@5283 = ~I'm sure there are some gnolls out there worth saving.~
@5284 = ~You don't know the half of it.~
@5285 = ~I ain't blinded by anything, <CHARNAME>. I hate them because I've seen. I've seen what they do, and I've never seen one that wouldn't do it.~
@5286 = ~Now hold on. You're naming all these other buggers, expecting me to say "Oh yeah, they're a buncha monsters too." You're *expecting* that. Which means you got some low opinions yourself. So who are you, telling me what to hate?~
@5287 = ~You think I'd like a demon if I met one? I'm talking what I've lived here. Yeah, I'd shoot a demon, but I can't hate something I've never had any business with.~
@5288 = ~Look, if I meet one good gnoll, which I haven't, all it means is there's one good gnoll. Doesn't say anything about the rest of 'em.~
@5289 = ~There's plenty of races that take slaves, but none are as bad as gnolls. Hobgoblins or whatever, they'll just smack you about if you don't do as you're told. Even drow, they'll only torture the disobedient ones.~
@5290 = ~Mm. That's assuming we're in a good mood. Which isn't often.~
@5291 = ~With gnolls, you don't even get a chance. Once they have you, they just hurt you and hurt you and hurt you until there's nothing left.~
@5292 = ~A few of our tribesmen got taken captive, once. We found 'em quick enough, cut their ropes, killed every last gnoll for leagues, but they just...sat there. They didn't understand they'd been rescued. Not even when we showed 'em the bodies.~
@5293 = ~No-one who'd do that to a person should live. No-one.~
@5294 = ~All I've ever had from gnolls is dead friends and scars. The day that changes, *maybe* I'll ease off the trigger. But that day ain't coming.~
@5295 = ~I dunno. Shoot other things? I always enjoy a good hunt.~
@5296 = ~There's fishing, too. Cooking. Making poultices and that. Ain't so much hobbies as necessities out in the forest, but once you learn to enjoy your day-to-day, what more do you need?~
@5297 = ~And for the record, I don't necessarily like shooting people. Some people just need shot.~
@5298 = ~I said, if you were raised by elves, how come-~
@5299 = ~I've never once heard an elf tell someone to sod off.~
@5300 = ~I heard you. I just don't understand the question.~
@5301 = ~Well then you ain't met my elves. What are you on about?~
@5302 = ~If you'd said "You don't talk much like an Evereskan", that'd make sense. Sort of. I ain't an Evereskan, so it'd be a stupid thing to say, but still.~
@5303 = ~I don't talk like an elf? What do elves talk like? There's elves all over the bloody world.~
@5304 = ~They talk like me. An elf.~
@5305 = ~I suppose I just expect elves to sound more...refined.~
@5306 = ~You're so earthy! Where's the fey side? The bouts of poetic melancholy? I haven't once seen you get misty-eyed over a tree.~
@5307 = ~You're telling me your whole tribe spoke the way you do?~
@5308 = ~An elf raised by humans, in a library on the arse-end of the crags. Fine. Make sure and let all the other elves know they're doing it wrong.~
@5309 = ~There's no aristocracy in the wild. Sounding fancy's all well and good, but at the end of the day, the point of talking is to say something.~
@5310 = ~<CHARNAME>, I can tell you this from experience. For each elf who waxes lyrical with every rising moon, there's another one jabbing his mates in the ribs, going "Listen to this wank."~
@5311 = ~All elves appreciate nature. Not all of 'em go on about it.~
@5312 = ~When they spoke Common, yeah. Which was mostly just when they were teaching it to me, but still. Go tell them they don't talk like elves. I'm sure that'll go down a treat.~
@5313 = ~Amin naa ille ninniach dulin.~
@5314 = ~What does that mean?~
@5315 = ~"I ain't your flamin' parrot."~
@5316 = ~On my face? Just clan markings. Nothing special.~
@5317 = ~Well, no. They *are* special. They just wouldn't mean much if you ain't in the tribe.~
@5318 = ~On your face? You mean there are others?~
@5319 = ~I've always wanted a tattoo.~
@5320 = ~They're quite pretty.~
@5321 = ~Look, let's just say elves like a drink, same as anyone.~
@5322 = ~You'd best make *sure* you want it. Don't get nothing stupid. I'm barely out of the forest and I've already seen three blokes in taverns with Love and Hate inked on their knuckles.~
@5323 = ~Heh. You appreciating the skill, or are you trying to flatter me?~
@5324 = ~I've always had an eye for good art.~
@5325 = ~If it was the second, what would you say?~
@5326 = ~I have to pick one?~
@5327 = ~You should see the ones my elders had. Fine as a spider's thread. I can't imagine how they sat still long enough to get 'em done, but then I'm only a halfling. Less time to spare.~
@5328 = ~I'd say you're off the mark. If I have nice tattoos, it says more about the artist than me, yeah?~
@5329 = ~You don't *have* to, but I'd rather you did. I'm a simple woman, <CHARNAME>. Double entendres make me twitchy. ~
@5330 = ~Do you? Stop using that line then, 'cause it won't get you any.~
@5331 = ~You'd have to look hard. My dad was the best on the coast, and...well, he ain't making any more.~
@5332 = ~You'd have to ask my dad, if we manage to find him. I ain't sure he's still doing 'em.~
@5333 = ~I don't know. My dad said he wasn't making 'em anymore, but I think that was more booze and misery than a proper retirement. Maybe once he's bucked himself up.~
@5334 = ~And this one is mine. I know you helped me with the gnolls, so if you ask for anything else, you'll have it and a smile. But not this.~
@5335 = ~I know. They make 'em in my size. I know that.~
@5336 = ~Why don't you, then?~
@5337 = ~'Cause I'm using this one.~
@5338 = ~That's like asking someone why they like breathing so much. How can you not?~
@5339 = ~Do you think you'll ever have some of your own?~
@5340 = ~Something must have started it, though.~
@5341 = ~You mean besides the fact that they're annoying, whiny, screechy...?~
@5342 = ~Ah...maybe. Probably. Once I've figured out what I'm doing with myself, and once I've found someone who can put up with me.~
@5343 = ~I think you'd make a wonderful mother.~
@5344 = ~Good luck with that.~
@5345 = ~I put up with you.~
@5346 = ~Not really. I just spent a lot of time with the young'uns back in the tribe. I think they liked me 'cause I didn't make 'em feel small. And I liked them because...well. Same reason, I suppose.~
@5347 = ~So you came out your mum all grown up and ready to go, is that it? Must've been a rough birth.~
@5348 = ~It's having things in common that brings people together, and what's the two things everyone in the world's got in common? We were all young, and we were all stupid. Celebrate it.~
@5349 = ~I can't argue with that.~
@5350 = ~I'd rather put that part of my life behind me. Far behind.~
@5351 = ~I wasn't stupid.~
@5352 = ~Heh, thanks. I hope you're not just saying that. If I can raise a child, raise 'em right, and know they'll think well of me when it's my time to go...there'll be no regrets. Not a one.~
@5353 = ~Kiss my arse.~
@5354 = ~My point exactly.~
@5355 = ~*And* once I've found someone who doesn't come charging at me lance-first. Dear oh dear.~
@5356 = ~You're also a woman. Not to slight anyone's preferences, but it don't really work as far as babies are concerned, does it?~
@5357 = ~We could always adopt.~
@5358 = ~Wait, you're a woman as well? I had no idea!~
@5359 = ~Damned right you can't. "Whiny." You ain't got nearly enough wrinkles to be that curmudgeonly.~
@5360 = ~Put it as far behind as you want. It'll still be there.~
@5361 = ~Yeah you were. Kids who think they know everything are the stupidest ones of the lot.~
@5362 = ~Gawd. <CHARNAME>, I ain't interested in girls, and even if I am, that don't mean I'm interested in *you*. Pull the reins, will you?~
@5363 = ~Haw haw haw. Excuse me for not wearing a dress. I hear they ain't much good against swords. ~
@5364 = ~Maybe we should just watch the road, yeah? Could be trouble about.~
@5365 = ~War. It's always war, innit? The answer to all of history's questions. You'd think people with so many years behind 'em would know better.~
@5366 = ~They used to be called green elves, you know. And they had nations. Huge forest cities where everyone was welcome. Then the dark elves came, and...I suppose the survivors decided that welcoming everyone was what cost 'em.~
@5367 = ~Solonor Thelandira, god of hunting and archery. Hardly a shocker, but there you go.~
@5368 = ~It's my own choice though, I'll say that much. Ain't just something I was raised on. Most of the tribe...~
@5369 = ~Have you heard of Fenmarel Mestarine?~
@5370 = ~The elven god of outcasts and isolation.~
@5371 = ~These elf gods all blur together in my head.~
@5372 = ~"The Lone Wolf." A lot of what he says is about how the elves have to make their own way in the world, how they mustn't trust anyone else or ask for help unless they absolutely have to.~
@5373 = ~That ain't something I can put my faith in. When people act like it's every man for himself, that just makes it true.~
@5374 = ~Would you really, or are you just making chit-chat?~
@5375 = ~I really would.~
@5376 = ~Just chit-chat.~
@5377 = ~He's the god of hunting, like I said. Only never for sport. Any animal you ain't planning to eat, you leave alone.~
@5378 = ~I'll sound like a druid, saying this, but it's about keeping the balance. People want to build settlements and feel safe, and that's fine, but they don't always think how it affects everything else. So it's up to us to teach 'em.~
@5379 = ~Nature's got a place for everyone in the world. You ain't gotta carve one out. Just look for it.~
@5380 = ~I won't bother preaching, then. But here's a story for you.~
@5381 = ~When I was around twelve, I heard about this ritual the priests have. Every turn of the moon, they mark an arrow with Solonor's symbol and shoot it into the sky. "To pierce the firmament and let the light of his teachings shine down on the faithful." Bit poncy, I know, but you have to do these things. So I thought I'd give it a go.~
@5382 = ~Only trouble is, whittling on a crossbow bolt is fiddly work. I was afraid if I didn't get it just right, Solonor would chuck the thing back at me and tell me I was rubbish. Must've ruined a dozen shafts trying to do it perfect.~
@5383 = ~By the time I'm finished, my hands are all bloody from where I nicked myself, and half the tribe's asked me what the hell I'm playing at. But I did it. And I shot it into the sky, like I was supposed to. And *just* as I did, a little sunray peeked through the clouds, right where I was standing.~
@5384 = ~That's the day I started believing.~
@5385 = ~Have they arse. I look like a boy dragged through a bush. And I don't approve of liars, so don't bother saying different.~
@5386 = ~Nothing wrong with rugged boyishness. Nothing at all.~
@5387 = ~Alright, alright. Just trying to be nice.~
@5388 = ~Oh. Well. Thanks, then.~
@5389 = ~*cough*~
@5390 = ~What, and I've got so little respect for myself that I need you to fill in? Piss off. Tell me I have good aim next time. At least that'll be the truth.~
@5391 = ~Oh, just...everything we could fit in a day. What have you been up to, what was my mum like, how'd you end up with that <CHARNAME> prat.~
@5392 = ~Heh, he told me he had a hell of a time getting the tribe to warm up to him. He just kept plaguing 'em and plaguing 'em until they were ready to smother him in honey and hang him up for the bears.~
@5393 = ~Then he got caught with 'em in a gnoll raid, ended up saving the chieftain's life. And that did it. I'd call it a tall tale, but that's about what it'd take to get a wild elf to trust you. Especially enough to...to take a baby off you.~
@5394 = ~Well. He said she was like me, and I asked what he meant by that. And he said "Like boiled leather. Rough, tough, doesn't bend easily."~
@5395 = ~I said "I didn't think you'd have liked that." And he said "She damned well made me."~
@5396 = ~I might finish my dad's book. Ain't sure I can write as pretty as he did, but I'll do my best. After that, who knows? I've got nothing tying me down, much like yourself. What do you reckon you'll do?~
@5397 = ~I'll continue adventuring, naturally.~
@5398 = ~I'll find a home and a way to earn a crust. I really just want a normal life.~
@5399 = ~It might not be up to me. Something tells me I'm not in for a peaceful future.~
@5400 = ~I haven't thought about it.~
@5401 = ~Fair enough, but you won't always be running into problems like this. There comes a time when "adventuring" is just wandering.~
@5402 = ~Yeah, I wouldn't blame you. You never asked for any of this.~
@5403 = ~Nah, things are bound to settle eventually. You keep stomping your enemies the way you are now, one day they'll decide you're best left alone.~
@5404 = ~Me neither. Not as much as I should've, at least. I always thought I'd live and die with the tribe, but now...~
@5405 = ~It's a bit scary, isn't it? Having this much freedom. But it's a blessing, even then. Don't forget that.~
@5406 = ~Soon, alright? Soon this'll be over and we'll find somewhere you can put your feet up.~
@5407 = ~You're...?~
@5408 = ~Nah.~
@5409 = ~I've never known him to be wrong, Littlun.~
@5410 = ~I find it hard to believe as well, but it's true.~
@5411 = ~You calling me a liar?~
@5412 = ~It ain't that. I'm just saying, you're <CHARNAME>. That's it.~
@5413 = ~What am I, if you look at me? A halfling? Sure. But I don't know sod about being one. I spent my whole life with elves. It's their ways that's in me, their gods, their community, their spirit.~
@5414 = ~But that don't make me an elf either, does it? I'm still a shortarse, and I'll still be lucky to make it past a century. So if, just going by how I was born, you can't really call me one thing or another, maybe that part don't matter so much. Maybe I'm just Littlun, and that's what counts.~
@5415 = ~And you...yeah, maybe you were born to some kind of murder god. But you grew up in a library with good, honest people, and you haven't let that part of yourself fade enough to make you a monster. Because if you had, I wouldn't be here, helping you out.~
@5416 = ~So maybe you're just <CHARNAME>. And that's what counts.~
@5417 = ~See if they have anything elven, would you? Feelin' a bit homesick.~
@5418 = ~This is supposed to be funny, is it? If you don't get this off before I have to start shaving, I guarantee you won't be laughing.~
@5419 = ~Well look at 'em. Never in my life have I seen tits that shiny. Those tits could blind someone. Those tits could signal a ship.~
@5420 = ~It's surprising, isn't it? You hear "Tempus" and you think of howling nutters who'd pick a fight with their own face.~
@5421 = ~Which she is. But there's more behind that, if you look. ~
@5422 = ~Uh...yes. But only when you said it just then.~
@5423 = ~Arrested bloody development is what's going on. That is a man who never grew past yanking on girls' pigtails to get their attention.~
@5424 = ~He had troubles as a young'un, and he had to fight through 'em, and now fighting's all he can think of 'cause it's the only solution he ever learned. Need to earn a living? Fight. Looking for information? Fight. Fancy someone? Fight.~
@5425 = ~There'll be a breakdown someday, <CHARNAME>. Mark my words. Sooner or later he'll get sick of fighting everyone and everything.~
@5426 = ~And what, one's the limit? If some hoity-toit fannies off to foreign lands on his personal galleon, you think he only brings one guard?~
@5427 = ~She's the only one I could save. If I let her die too, it was all for nothing.~
@5428 = ~He wants Dynaheir dead, <CHARNAME>. If he hunted her that far, he ain't gonna give up just 'cause you said so.~
@5429 = ~I know it ain't for me to decide, but I'd be ten times happier if we left him behind. ~
@5430 = ~So would I.~
@5431 = ~Like him or not, he's a powerful mage. I'd rather he be on our side than someone else's.~
@5432 = ~You're right. It's not for you to decide.~
@5433 = ~Then what are you waiting for?~
@5434 = ~That's where you're going wrong. He'll never be on anyone's side but his own.~
@5435 = ~Then *you* need to decide. I'm telling you, it's him or her. Any day now.~
@5436 = ~Lives are more important than making a point. And even if they weren't, it's the wrong way to make it. ~
@5437 = ~You put it in people's heads that nature's an enemy, it gives 'em all the more reason to destroy it. And there's maybe one Shadow Druid for every ten thousand normal people, so any war they start, they'll lose. They'll only end up hurting what they're meant to protect.~
@5438 = ~I ain't. I'm opposed to being an employee.~
@5439 = ~I never needed gold to get by, and I don't plan to develop a habit. Just shiny weight, as far as I'm concerned. And if I ever answer to anyone, it won't be some pennypinching miseryguts.~
@5440 = ~He's a smart bloke. He'll sound a bit of a bumpkin, learning it from me, but he'll be alright. Long as he don't have to talk to any sun elves.~
@5441 = ~I like teaching him. Growing up the way I did, I had two dozen years to learn what everyone else did in a hundred. It feels nice to be the one in the know for a change.~
@5442 = ~"Caryavendengin", thank you very much. In fact, you can call me any stupid nickname you want as long as you say it in elven. Then it'll sound dignified.~
@5443 = ~<CHARNAME>, he couldn't be *more* likely to turn on us. It might not do any good, but it won't do any harm either.~
@5444 = ~Gods, don't start. I still don't even know what an aarakocra is. Just that they migrate. And apparently it's a big deal and very complicated and takes the better part of a sodding afternoon to explain.~
@5445 = ~Yeah. Don't know much about this Sun Soul lot, but it sounds like they're a good bunch. And sometimes you just need a reminder that it ain't all dog eat dog.~
@5446 = ~I know. I'm banging my head on a wall. But if someone's trapped behind the wall, that's just what I have to do. At least then they know someone's trying.~
@5447 = ~I don't know. I'm sure she *thinks* they deserved it, but that don't mean much.~
@5448 = ~On the other hand, I know a lot of folks'd see a drow on the surface and not think twice. And drow or not, when a woman's alone, lost, probably weak...there's people who'll take advantage.~
@5449 = ~There's no good answer. And we'll never know one way or the other. I'd rather not think about it.~
@5450 = ~I'll headbutt you, <CHARNAME>. I swear I will. Don't think I won't come up there.~
@5451 = ~I'll headbutt you, <CHARNAME>. I swear I will.~
@5452 = ~Couldn't tell you. It's the idea of living underground, mainly. Ten paces into the mines and I already wanted to go out for some fresh air.~
@5453 = ~Still. Not many homes out there where I wouldn't have to get used to something. And you can't put a price on feeling welcome.~
@5454 = ~Who, Dave? "Priest of Talos" my arse. The only thing I seen him do so far is hand out them stupid parchments.~
@5455 = ~Anything worse, I'll tell him to bend down for a cuff round the ear. He'd probably do it, too.~
@5456 = ~I believe *she* believes what she says, and I can't help feeling sorry for her. If it's true, she's stuck in the wrong shape, scared and vulnerable, wondering who she really is. If it ain't, she's mental. Not a nice place to be either way.~
@5457 = ~That said, she still gets right on my tits. Bossy wee cow.~
@5458 = ~They say of all the senses, smell is tied tightest to memory. You much catch a whiff of an old book now and then and remember Candlekeep, yeah?~
@5459 = ~Didn't think I'd catch myself introspecting around Moidre, though. I dunno. Maybe I thought it'd open her up a bit. Or maybe I just needed to say it to someone I knew would listen.~
@5460 = ~You mean how do I not shoot him? That's about as far as it goes.~
@5461 = ~Every time I get the urge, I think about how I'd have turned out if the drow took me in, instead of the wild elves. Not well, I imagine.~
@5462 = ~They'd probably have just killed you.~
@5463 = ~So you don't think it's possible for someone to overcome their upbringing?~
@5464 = ~That's more tolerant than most people would be.~
@5465 = ~Exactly. If you ain't like them, they'll either twist you and break you until you are, or they'll bleed you out. Especially the men. It's a rare bloke that wouldn't end up the way he did.~
@5466 = ~'Course it's possible. Same way it's "possible" for a starving beggar to get rich. That don't mean it's fair to sit back and expect it.~
@5467 = ~Well don't get me wrong. If I ever catch him hurting someone who don't deserve it, the last thing you'll call me is "tolerant." But until then? We'll see. ~
@5468 = ~All things considered, he could be worse. He ain't cruel. He just don't care. No-one taught him to.~
@5469 = ~Had enough of me, eh? Is there somewhere I should go in case you change your mind?~
@5470 = ~The Friendly Arm will do well enough.~
@5471 = ~I already did. Come on back.~
@5472 = ~I'd be as happy staying outside, but you're the boss.~
@5473 = ~Fair enough. I'll make sure nothing's following you.~
@5474 = ~Are you sure, <CHARNAME>? This ain't just me repaying a favour anymore. I'm well in now.~
@5475 = ~That's true. Let's stick it out together, then.~
@5476 = ~'Bout that time, is it? Good. Staying put too long gives me jitters.~
@5477 = ~I'm ready to leave when you are.~
@5478 = ~I'm just checking in. I don't need you at the moment.~
@5479 = ~I just want my daughter back...~
@5480 = ~Don't mind me. Just part of the furniture.~
@5481 = ~Thanks.~
@5482 = ~Why did you help me?~
@5483 = ~I could have handled him.~
@5484 = ~For the excuse. Couple of tankards in him, thinks he can charm the mail off me. Couple more, forgets he already tried.~
@5485 = ~He's been aching for my boot all day. Kept asking to see my beard, and I'm not talking chins.~
@5486 = ~Never said you couldn't. Means you had nothing to prove.~
@5487 = ~How'd you get scum like him after you?~
@5488 = ~Theft, murder, arson, take your pick.~
@5489 = ~I'm not sure yet.~
@5490 = ~I only know who wants me dead, not why.~
@5491 = ~None of your business.~
@5492 = ~Either joking or crazy. Suppose we'll see.~
@5493 = ~Usually how it goes. No bonuses for exposition.~
@5494 = ~"Who" is all you need. "Why" is just curiosity.~
@5495 = ~Any case, seems you could use a bodyguard.~
@5496 = ~Are you offering?~
@5497 = ~I can take care of myself.~
@5498 = ~How much?~
@5499 = ~Practically already started, no?~
@5500 = ~One thug with an axe. If you're important enough, there'll be more, and they'll be better.~
@5501 = ~Tell you what. You know about the iron crisis? "Demons in the mines"? Hundred percent discount if we look into it.~
@5502 = ~What iron crisis? This is the first I've heard of it.~
@5503 = ~What do you care about the crisis?~
@5504 = ~I'd be honoured to have you.~
@5505 = ~You'll do it for free? I'd be a fool to turn that down.~
@5506 = ~I don't need your services at this time.~
@5507 = ~Where've you been? Coast iron's gone rotten lately. Barely lasts a tenday before it turns to breadcrumbs. ~
@5508 = ~And what's your incentive to investigate this?~
@5509 = ~Seeing as you're doing it for free, I'd be a fool to turn you down.~
@5510 = ~Hell on business.~
@5511 = ~This hammer? Fifth I've bought this month. Had to headbutt a gibberling to death a while ago. Time I killed it, my client was wolf feed. Had to drag him to Baldur's Gate and pay for a raise out of my own pocket.~
@5512 = ~Why not just leave him?~
@5513 = ~That doesn't give me much confidence in your abilities.~
@5514 = ~Don't be.~
@5515 = ~Wouldn't be so sure.~
@5516 = ~Suit yourself. Change your mind, I'll be here a while.~
@5517 = ~Said I'd get him there alive. Deal's a deal.~
@5518 = ~My weapon might break. So might yours. Better two than one.~
@5519 = ~Alak minn orn nagh mair. Take my life in your hands. Let me suffer where you would have suffered. Let me bleed where you would have bled. Let me fall where you would have fallen.~
@5520 = ~Death unbinds, and only death. My shield is my self, till my days are done.~
@5521 = ~"Alak min orn nagh mair?" A heavy pledge for someone you just met.~
@5522 = ~What was that?~
@5523 = ~Uh, right. On we go, then.~
@5524 = ~It's important. Keeps me straight.~
@5525 = ~Oath.~
@5526 = ~Do you swear oaths to all your clients?~
@5527 = ~There's no need to go that far.~
@5528 = ~Still available, if you're interested.~
@5529 = ~I'd be honoured to have you join me.~
@5530 = ~Will you still do it for free? If so, I'd be a fool to turn you down.~
@5531 = ~I'm not.~
@5532 = ~Well isn't this just the story of my life.~
@5533 = ~Know the name. Know the tower too. Hope this isn't going where I think it is.~
@5534 = ~Any answer but "Gods no" and you'll be making my job real difficult.~
@5535 = ~Least somebody here has some sense.~
@5536 = ~Don't be too eager to escape. Place like this, deaf to the world's troubles...it's not the prison you think it is.~
@5537 = ~Huh. Either we've met a lightweight sailor or that's one hell of a brew. Might have to pick some up myself. For research.~
@5538 = ~There's the power of an oath for you. Simple words, but it keeps them anchored, spitting in death's face.~
@5539 = ~Tan am sonn.~
@5540 = ~Sane people quit after something like that. Explains the shortage of sane adventurers.~
@5541 = ~Somehow got the feeling it doesn't.~
@5542 = ~Doesn't look like a courier to me. Answer carefully.~
@5543 = ~Ooze booze? Knew humans couldn't brew worth a damn, but I didn't realise it was this bad.~
@5544 = ~Heard it before, every which way, from worse and from better. Still kicking.~
@5545 = ~If you have to introduce yourself as the Coast's greatest swordsman, you aren't.~
@5546 = ~Strange how they all say that. A "competent" bounty hunter would notice the pattern.~
@5547 = ~Might've been easy coins waiting for us to sleep. Now I don't like your chances.~
@5548 = ~Grab some shade. Archers lurking.~
@5549 = ~Careful. Someone pays gold just to talk to you, they mean to get it back. ~
@5550 = ~Only capacity I ever work in.~
@5551 = ~Easiest interrogation I've ever seen. If everyone folded that quick, there'd be a lot less busted knees in the world.~
@5552 = ~Healing in penance. Might've done the same myself, on better terms with the gods.~
@5553 = ~Don't promise before you know. This is not a road you want to walk.~
@5554 = ~Exactly what someone would say before commencing hostilities.~
@5555 = ~Guard up. This one's too chummy.~
@5556 = ~Gallows would've been kinder to him. You don't come back from something like this.~
@5557 = ~Bag twenty corpses, keep my own count, 150 gold. All for a peaceful night. Wish more clients were this simple.~
@5558 = ~Big job, guarding you. Wonder sometimes if I'm up to it.~
@5559 = ~You've done fine work so far.~
@5560 = ~So do I.~
@5561 = ~Surely you've had more important clients than me.~
@5562 = ~Didn't I say I don't need protection? You're just here so we can make shorter work of my enemies.~
@5563 = ~It'd be a smaller job with less talk. Be quiet.~
@5564 = ~"So far" doesn't mean anything. You only did fine when it's over.~
@5565 = ~Good thing you didn't pay in advance. Or at all, really.~
@5566 = ~Might've done. Might've wondered then, too.~
@5567 = ~That attitude's what makes it a big job.~
@5568 = ~Been working one-offs for a while now. Smugglers. Cons who con the wrong people. You want to keep your business dark, you don't hire long-term. This is a jump.~
@5569 = ~You take jobs with criminals?~
@5570 = ~You could do better than that.~
@5571 = ~I hadn't pegged you for the type.~
@5572 = ~Shady dealings, eh? I knew there was more to you.~
@5573 = ~They don't say they're criminals when they hire me.~
@5574 = ~No I can't. Tried it.~
@5575 = ~Only thing I'm good at. Not much room to fuss.~
@5576 = ~There isn't. I don't get into devilry. I just take lumps for those who do.~
@5577 = ~What did you expect? People who deserve bodyguards don't pick them up in taverns.~
@5578 = ~I picked you up in a tavern.~
@5579 = ~Don't offer your services in taverns, then!~
@5580 = ~I resent that.~
@5581 = ~Then why not stop working for them?~
@5582 = ~Bad people put up good fronts.~
@5583 = ~And what? You're an exception? Haven't done much to convince me.~
@5584 = ~I'll rephrase. People who deserve bodyguards don't pick me.~
@5585 = ~Resent away. Truth's truth.~
@5586 = ~And starve to death? Thought about it. Still do.~
@5587 = ~Someone teach you to fight, or did you just pick it up as you went?~
@5588 = ~I wouldn't exactly call myself a fighter.~
@5589 = ~I took lessons with the guards in Candlekeep.~
@5590 = ~The latter. I've had to pick lots of things up lately.~
@5591 = ~Neither. It's just a gift.~
@5592 = ~More to it than hitting people. Acting fast, keeping your wits, positioning yourself. Takes a fighter's brain to handle that. ~
@5593 = ~Think you mostly picked it up, then. No offence to them, but I doubt it takes much to guard books.~
@5594 = ~Sink or swim. Best way. No substitute for the real thing, risk aside.~
@5595 = ~Raw talent, is it? Had me fooled. Or you're just full of crap.~
@5596 = ~Not commenting on your skills, mind. Just wondering where normal people learn to do this.~
@5597 = ~What do you mean?~
@5598 = ~I'm hardly normal, Moidre.~
@5599 = ~So you're an abnormal person?~
@5600 = ~You're not a soldier. That's what I mean. You weren't...~
@5601 = ~You're not a soldier.~
@5602 = ~Are you?~
@5603 = ~I wasn't what?~
@5604 = ~Soldiers aren't the only ones who can kill.~
@5605 = ~Never mind. Shouldn't be chatting anyway. Ignore me.~
@5606 = ~Hng...huh?!~
@5607 = ~Moidre? ~
@5608 = ~Keep it down over there!~
@5609 = ~Did you see something?~
@5610 = ~Oh. Sorry. Fell asleep.~
@5611 = ~Why are you sorry? We're supposed to be sleeping.~
@5612 = ~Still standing guard, are you?~
@5613 = ~Don't let it happen again.~
@5614 = ~Are you saying you don't sleep?~
@5615 = ~Maybe not "standing" guard.~
@5616 = ~Do my best.~
@5617 = ~Not on purpose. Not when I'm working.~
@5618 = ~You've done some tossing and turning yourself lately. Nightmares?~
@5619 = ~Yes. About my foster father's death and...something else. A voice.~
@5620 = ~Not exactly. Just strange dreams. Vivid ones.~
@5621 = ~No. I'm just a restless sleeper.~
@5622 = ~No. Some elves are just restless during trances.~
@5623 = ~Goodnight, Moidre.~
@5624 = ~Wouldn't worry. Someone close dies, it's natural they'll linger. And hearing voices is only madness when you're awake.~
@5625 = ~Better strange than grim. Wouldn't fault you for sleeping the day away, if strange is the worst you can say.~
@5626 = ~Restless is right. Roll around so much I near have to drag you back to camp.~
@5627 = ~I used to have dreams. Proper dreams, the sort you'd tell people about. Can't remember them anymore, but I know I had them.~
@5628 = ~These days I just dream of work. Go to sleep, do a day's toil in my head, wake up ready for bed. Don't know why I bother.~
@5629 = ~Sounds like you're tired of your job. Why not do something else?~
@5630 = ~Bother sleeping, or bother in general?~
@5631 = ~I wouldn't rest either if I didn't have to.~
@5632 = ~I know why I bother. Goodnight.~
@5633 = ~Ever get tired of adventuring?~
@5634 = ~Either.~
@5635 = ~Gods' way of keeping us in check. Imagine how fast we could ruin the world if we didn't have to stop and lie down sometimes.~
@5636 = ~But you're still doing it.~
@5637 = ~You wouldn't understand, then.~
@5638 = ~Anyway. Up now. Think I'll just stay up. Sleep safe.~
@5639 = ~(Let me suffer where you would have suffered. Let me bleed where you would have bled. Let me die where you would have died. My shield is my self...)~
@5640 = ~What are you doing?~
@5641 = ~(ignore her)~
@5642 = ~The oath. Have to recite it every day, even just to myself. Suppose you were bound to notice eventually.~
@5643 = ~You "have" to recite it?~
@5644 = ~That doesn't sound like mercenary training to me.~
@5645 = ~Where did that oath come from? Surely you didn't just make it up.~
@5646 = ~Well. Don't *have* to. But I do.~
@5647 = ~Know a lot of mercenaries?~
@5648 = ~Why not? Someone has to make them up.~
@5649 = ~It's difficult, the world. Everyone's uncertain sometimes. Some more than others. Helps to have something to go by when hesitation can kill you.~
@5650 = ~Most people would go by their morals.~
@5651 = ~You mustn't have much confidence in it, if you have to keep repeating it to yourself.~
@5652 = ~I say a person should trust their instincts.~
@5653 = ~I've never hesitated in my life.~
@5654 = ~Morals need a foundation. Otherwise they're just feelings.~
@5655 = ~Priests say their prayers every day. Doesn't mean they don't believe.~
@5656 = ~Instinct tells you to flinch when you should follow through. Instinct tells you to rest when you need to press on. It's the last thing a person should trust.~
@5657 = ~Live longer. Then that'll be something to boast about.~
@5658 = ~Tan am sonn. "Be as stone." Oldest dwarven saying. Not just a saying; a fond wish, a farewell. A battlecry and a wedding vow. A drinking song and a hymn. It's everything.~
@5659 = ~Oaths are stone. Keep to them, and they'll brace you against the world. Walk away and they'll loom at your back forever. But they stand, with or without you.~
@5660 = ~So as long as you keep your oaths, no matter what it takes, it means you're a good person?~
@5661 = ~I agree. A person's word is the only thing that matters.~
@5662 = ~I'd sooner betray an oath than betray myself.~
@5663 = ~What a load of nonsense.~
@5664 = ~It means you're stone. Sometimes that's all a person can be.~
@5665 = ~Then you don't agree, because that's not what I said.~
@5666 = ~You decided you're worth more. Some people didn't.~
@5667 = ~Maybe. Best I've got, though.~
@5668 = ~What's that human saying? "History repeats itself"? It really does.~
@5669 = ~Everyone in Baldur's Gate thinks this Rieltar is their saviour. Swooping in with his iron when all hope seemed lost, arming them for a war they'd have died in otherwise.~
@5670 = ~Everyone in Baldur's Gate thinks Sarevok is their saviour. Swooping in with his iron when all hope seemed lost, arming them for a war they'd have died in otherwise.~
@5671 = ~Every one of them is wrong. And if I told them, not a single one would listen.~
@5672 = ~And that's history repeating itself?~
@5673 = ~I'm not sure what you mean.~
@5674 = ~Don't be too upset. They wouldn't listen to me either.~
@5675 = ~For me and for the world. Pick a date, pick a place, somewhere you'll find a Rieltar. Just so happens this is my second.~
@5676 = ~For me and for the world. Pick a date, pick a place, somewhere you'll find a Sarevok. Just so happens this is my second.~
@5677 = ~You've wondered where I came from? Who I used to work for? Look at Rieltar. There's your answer, more or less.~
@5678 = ~You worked for Rieltar?!~
@5679 = ~Can you elaborate?~
@5680 = ~So you've been in this position before.~
@5681 = ~You've wondered where I came from? Who I used to work for? Look at Sarevok. There's your answer, more or less.~
@5682 = ~You worked for Sarevok?!~
@5683 = ~*sigh* You're dense sometimes.~
@5684 = ~I was kuldarsamman to my clan leader. "Trusted warrior." Some humans call us dwarven defenders.~
@5685 = ~Hand-picked as a child, trained day and night to be a living wall. Body and mind. "My shield is my self, till my days are done."~
@5686 = ~From childhood? That sounds like an awful life.~
@5687 = ~That explains a lot.~
@5688 = ~Hand-picked as a child? What, did they notice you clubbing the other kids with a stick?~
@5689 = ~It's the greatest honour a mortal dwarf can give. Especially for...for me. More than I deserved.~
@5690 = ~Never in a million years thought anyone would envy me. Tried to be humble about it, but I'd watch the peasants as we marched from the keep, see the way they looked at me and...~
@5691 = ~Well. That's moot. Once you start seeing people as "peasants", it's already gone to your head.~
@5692 = ~You mean you had an ego? I'm not sure I believe this story.~
@5693 = ~I knew you weren't just a mercenary.~
@5694 = ~So how was your clan leader like Rieltar?~
@5695 = ~So how was your clan leader like Sarevok?~
@5696 = ~Noticed the other kids clubbing me, maybe. Noticed I didn't flinch much.~
@5697 = ~Don't know if I'd go that far. I was proud of my place, not of myself.~
@5698 = ~I was, looking back. A glorified one, a well-trained one, but still.~
@5699 = ~It's a story. And I'm not much of a teller. Do you really want to hear it?~
@5700 = ~The mysterious Moidre finally wants to shed some light on herself! As if I'd turn that down.~
@5701 = ~Nope! Just lost all interest.~
@5702 = ~<CHARNAME>, this whole thing, my clan, my home...~
@5703 = ~We...the clan...we were recovering from war. Duergar. They lost, but so did we. Thousands dead and nothing to show for it but scars and debt.~
@5704 = ~Our old leader died in battle, but his son, the one I served, he was young and bright. Full of ideas. More thinker than fighter, but that was what we needed then. We all believed he'd find us a way through it.~
@5705 = ~And he did. Adamantine. Strongest metal in the world, as far as we know. More valuable than gold. Trouble is, most of it's in the Underdark. Can't risk that. Barely enough of us left to mine iron.~
@5706 = ~Drow, though. The dark elves. They have plenty. And the ones nearer the surface, the Vhaeraunites, they'll trade when it suits them. Only problem is finding something they want.~
@5707 = ~Gold?~
@5708 = ~Gems?~
@5709 = ~Weapons?~
@5710 = ~People.~
@5711 = ~Human settlements, sometimes halflings or gnomes. Small ones. We'd come to them in friendship and take them in the night, and there was our adamantine. More than most clans had ever seen. Enough to start rebuilding.~
@5712 = ~And you participated in this?~
@5713 = ~Smart thinking, I say.~
@5714 = ~That's absolutely despicable.~
@5715 = ~That so. Maybe you should wait for the end before you decide.~
@5716 = ~Yes. It is. But it worked, at least for a while.~
@5717 = ~He used convicts, you see. Long as they did the raids and kept quiet, they'd stay out of prison. But you can't just leave a pack of thieves and murderers to themselves. Someone had to keep them in line.~
@5718 = ~"It's them or us," he said. "You're my greatest warrior, my most trusted warrior. Do it for our clan. For me."~
@5719 = ~Wasn't so bad at first. I'd march the prisoners home, next day they'd be gone. Easy not to think about it. Problem is, fresh captives don't make good slaves.~
@5720 = ~You get a better deal if they're already broken in.~
@5721 = ~You tortured people?!~
@5722 = ~This just keeps getting worse.~
@5723 = ~This just keeps getting better.~
@5724 = ~Ho ho! A whole different skill set! I thought you said you were only good at fighting?~
@5725 = ~If there's one thing I can say in my defence; and it might be the only thing; it's that I wasn't involved in that part.~
@5726 = ~He had others. Professionals. I asked how he found them so quickly, where all the equipment came from, and he just gave me this...this confused little smile. Like it shouldn't even have occurred to me that he didn't already have them.~
@5727 = ~That's when I knew. This wasn't just some desperate measure. He wasn't going to stop. He'd always been this way and I never noticed.~
@5728 = ~All I ever saw was that proud face and those young, bright eyes. That's all anyone saw. Could've told the whole clan, every last detail, and not one would've believed me. He knew that. That's why he picked me.~
@5729 = ~Why wouldn't they believe you specifically?~
@5730 = ~I can't believe you took part in all this.~
@5731 = ~I can respect a man like that. Putting himself and his people ahead of everyone else.~
@5732 = ~Moidre, I can't keep you in my company. Not after hearing what you've done.~
@5733 = ~...history. They had reason not to trust me.~
@5734 = ~I couldn't either sometimes. But then I'd look at our clanhold and see the state we were in. The squalor. Children with bones showing through their skin. And maybe, just for the time being, we had to do what we could.~
@5735 = ~He's dead, <CHARNAME>, and so are his people. It was all for nothing. Does that deserve respect?~
@5736 = ~Yeah. I think...I think that might be the reason I told you. Someone like me shouldn't be around someone like you, and it's past time you learned why.~
@5737 = ~I swore to protect you, but if you won't have me, all I can do is wish you luck. I hope that's worth something to you. I hope...~
@5738 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@5739 = ~My oath was the only thing I had, in the end. Only thing I knew. My shield is my self. And thank the gods for that. Wasn't much of myself left.~
@5740 = ~<CHARNAME>.~ ~I'm...~
@5741 = ~You know the duergar? The grey dwarves?~
@5742 = ~Hah, here it comes. I knew it.~
@5743 = ~No, I don't.~
@5744 = ~You're one of them?~
@5745 = ~I have their blood in me.~
@5746 = ~From the Underdark. What drow are to elves, duergar are to dwarves. And...~
@5747 = ~Half.~
@5748 = ~I'm sick of pretending. You deserve to know. I'm half duergar. Half of a real dwarf.~
@5749 = ~...okay, half-right. Good enough.~
@5750 = ~My father was a duergar spy, during the war. Don't like to think what happened between him and my mother, but it happened, whatever it was.~
@5751 = ~Dunno if she knew the whole time, what she'd be bringing into the world, or if she only realised it when I came out the wrong colour. Dunno which would be worse, honestly. Either way, she decided I wasn't hers.~
@5752 = ~Remember I told you my clan leader chose me for his guard? That was why it mattered so much. Me. Half a person. Nothing to something, just like that.~
@5753 = ~Everyone advised against it. Everyone. Told him I'd turn round and break his skull the first chance I had. That's why he knew I'd keep quiet, because there was no point talking. Whatever I said against him would've meant nothing. Just hateful slander from greyskin trash.~
@5754 = ~Is this why you hide your face?~
@5755 = ~So where is your father now?~
@5756 = ~Were you mistreated growing up, then?~
@5757 = ~There's no such thing as half a person. You're just a person.~
@5758 = ~Why did you tell me this?~
@5759 = ~Alright, so you're half-grey. Good to know. Was there anything else?~
@5760 = ~Is there no end to the secrets with you? If you can't be upfront with me, I think it's time you left.~
@5761 = ~...I don't know. Am I hiding it? We did train to wear armour all day. It was a rare moment I bared my head, even back then. But I did.~
@5762 = ~Maybe I don't want to be seen as a duergar. Or maybe I just don't want to be seen.~
@5763 = ~No idea. Dead, probably. Could be I killed him myself in the war. Wouldn't know him if I saw him. Wouldn't matter if I did.~
@5764 = ~The other children threw their stones, but I got used to that. It was the men and women. They didn't want me to exist, but nor they didn't want a child's blood on their hands. So they pretended I wasn't there. No matter what I did, what I said, they'd look everywhere but at me.~
@5765 = ~I hope you never know how it feels to live like that. Just a mistake that nobody wants to be the one to fix.~
@5766 = ~Not to my mother. Not to the clan. Not even to the duergar, if I somehow went to them. They'd cut my throat and leave me unburied. And I'd get the same from these people now, if they knew. ~
@5767 = ~What? No answer?~
@5768 = ~We both know this wasn't idle conversation.~
@5769 = ~Come on, spit it out.~
@5770 = ~...I understand.~
@5771 = ~I don't know what my place is in the world. Maybe I was never meant to have one. I just know it's not with you. Not anymore. You deserve better than me.~
@5772 = ~I hope you find it, <CHARNAME>.~
@5773 = ~I just needed to know. I needed to know what you'd think. What you'd say.~
@5774 = ~Did you think it would bother me? You're a worthy companion and I trust you, no matter what's under that helmet. Stop trying to diminish yourself.~
@5775 = ~I barely even know what a duergar is. I've never met one, never dealt with them. It means nothing to me. Nothing's changed. So let's just continue on.~
@5776 = ~I'm not some superstitious idiot. Rumours don't interest me. Facts do. And the fact is, you fight for me and fight well. Continue to do so and we'll have no problems, whatever you are.~
@5777 = ~I think you've hidden one too many things from me, and it'd be best if you went on your way before things get worse.~
@5778 = ~I say go, and don't come back. I won't travel another step with you at my side.~
@5779 = ~...thank you.~
@5780 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@5781 = ~Have you ever done something you regretted?~
@5782 = ~Not particularly.~
@5783 = ~Running from Sarevok. I should have stayed with Gorion. ~
@5784 = ~More than I can remember.~
@5785 = ~Drinking so much last night.~
@5786 = ~Suppose you're still young.~
@5787 = ~You'd have died. I'm not saying I don't understand. Not even saying I wouldn't have done it myself. But you would have died.~
@5788 = ~You don't regret it that much if you don't remember it.~
@5789 = ~No. Something real. Something that sticks with you beyond the next day.~
@5790 = ~It's just...what do you do? If you can't take it back, what else is there?~
@5791 = ~You can't undo bad deeds. You can only do good ones.~
@5792 = ~Nothing. You just have to live with it.~
@5793 = ~Drink to forget?~
@5794 = ~Who cares? Just move on. What's done is done.~
@5795 = ~Enough to tip the scales. Problem is, the bad ones weigh more.~
@5796 = ~No. I'm done living with it. I'd rather die without it.~
@5797 = ~Hah. I'm half-duergar, <CHARNAME>. There'd be droughts before I forgot.~
@5798 = ~*I* care. I wouldn't have asked if I didn't care. But you don't have an answer, obviously.~
@5799 = ~Maybe...maybe I could go back. To the drow camps. Some of my captives might still be alive. If I could even save *one*...~
@5800 = ~You can't just go and storm the Underdark! That's suicide!~
@5801 = ~Do you really think you could look them in the eye after what you did?~
@5802 = ~Just freeing them isn't enough. You'd have to lead them to safety, help them rebuild their lives. Are you ready for that responsibility?~
@5803 = ~No. It has to be me. Just me. I'm not dragging anyone else down.~
@5804 = ~Going into the Underdark alone is suicide, Moidre.~
@5805 = ~If that's how you want it...~
@5806 = ~If you go alone, you'll die. That's all that'll happen. Do you really want to save them, or do you just want to make a noble sacrifice?~
@5807 = ~Dying doesn't scare me. Never has. And when I meet the gods, at least I can tell them I tried.~
@5808 = ~I don't have to look anyone in the eye. Not since I put this helmet on.~
@5809 = ~I'm ready to try. Best anyone can say.~
@5810 = ~It is. My mistake, my problem, my fight. Nobody else is suffering because of me.~
@5811 = ~Right. You're right. If I die, I die, but it has to be for something. I need a proper plan.~
@5812 = ~I doubt they're still alive, but that won't stop me. Doubt kept me in a rut for years, doing the same thing over and over again. Swearing oaths left and right just for something to hold on to. Holding a shield in front of crooks because everyone's a crook deep down, and holding a shield is all I'm good for.~
@5813 = ~I'm done listening to doubt.~
@5814 = ~Is this where we part ways, then?~
@5815 = ~About time. Do what you need to do.~
@5816 = ~Just a minute. You're not done working for me yet.~
@5817 = ~I'm not going anywhere, <CHARNAME>. Not just yet. Whatever else happens, we'll finish this first. We'll stop your enemies, because this war of theirs won't mean anything. And...~
@5818 = ~And because you deserve to live.~
@5819 = ~Been doing some thinking, <CHARNAME>. About you. About this battle we're fighting. Lots of things. But mostly about myself. Took a long time, lot of wrestling and soul-searching, but I've finally come to a decision, for better or worse.~
@5820 = ~I need a bath.~
@5821 = ~Thank the gods.~
@5822 = ~Yes. You do. You do need a bath. Please take a bath, Moidre. Go and take a bath. Take one. Go.~
@5823 = ~Are you inviting me?~
@5824 = ~Yeah yeah. Got any soap? Preferably some you won't want back.~
@5825 = ~Alright, alright. Don't rush me. This is big.~
@5826 = ~No. If I see you, I drown you. Sod the oath.~
@5827 = ~Be the first time I've disarmoured in ages, so promise you won't get hurt while I'm busy. The irony alone would kill me.~
@5828 = ~I'm sure I can manage.~
@5829 = ~I'll gladly take that risk.~
@5830 = ~Anyone shows up, I'll ask if they can wait a few minutes.~
@5831 = ~Here goes nothing...~
@5832 = ~Gods. Never worked so hard in my life.~
@5833 = ~How do you feel?~
@5834 = ~No details, please. The nose knows.~
@5835 = ~...clean.~
@5836 = ~That's all?~
@5837 = ~And how are you finding this new sensation?~
@5838 = ~Your hesitance speaks volumes.~
@5839 = ~Glad to hear it. Let's go.~
@5840 = ~Refreshed. Tingly.~
@5841 = ~Eh. Probably won't hold up long once we're marching again. Sweat builds up quick. Have to make it a habit, I suppose.~
@5842 = ~Well what do you feel like after a bath? You've more experience than I do. Dunno why you're asking.~
@5843 = ~Bit raw as well, maybe. A lot of dead skin came off.~
@5844 = ~Any chance we could take off that helmet now?~
@5845 = ~That's disgusting and you're disgusting and we're not talking about this anymore. ~
@5846 = ~Ask me again when you're safe.~
@5847 = ~That's your end of the bargain, then. I'm here till you say otherwise.~
@5848 = ~What, just like that?~
@5849 = ~I plan to track down these bandits, so you'd better be sure.~
@5850 = ~Glad to have you. Just be warned, it's not going to get less dangerous.~
@5851 = ~I'm saying otherwise now. Time you went on your way.~
@5852 = ~Good. Don't speak until I say otherwise either.~
@5853 = ~That was the deal.~
@5854 = ~Makes no difference if you're invading the Nine Hells. I gave the oath.~
@5855 = ~You're the boss.~
@5856 = ~Not like I have much else anyway. Least you did something worthwhile. More than I can say for most clients.~
@5857 = ~If I can do something to help people, I will.~
@5858 = ~Don't start thinking this is some charity mission. I'm doing this for my own sake. ~
@5859 = ~You'll find there's much more you can say for me than most people.~
@5860 = ~And who were these other clients?~
@5861 = ~Easily said.~
@5862 = ~Everyone's got an agenda. No need to warn me.~
@5863 = ~Not necessarily a good thing.~
@5864 = ~No-one you'd know, and no-one you'd need to.~
@5865 = ~*sigh* Knew there'd be slaves. Knew it.~
@5866 = ~We'll free them. I promise.~
@5867 = ~Of course there are. Nobody *wants* to do back-breaking labour for evil organisations.~
@5868 = ~Does that bother you?~
@5869 = ~Anyone too weak to seize their freedom deserves slavery.~
@5870 = ~Don't. Don't make promises. If you really want to do something, you shouldn't need to promise. Just do it.~
@5871 = ~Nobody wants to do back-breaking labour at all. It's just better than starving.~
@5872 = ~I don't understand why you need to ask that.~
@5873 = ~That so? Alright. Let's have you stripped and beaten until you can't stand up. Let's chain you to a wall so long you forget how your arms work. Let's leave you starving alone in the darkness until your brain rots. Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you don't deserve what you can't win back.~
@5874 = ~There's no fair fight, you ignorant bastard. You don't have your swords and your magic, or your friends. You don't have anything but the work you're given. That's your world, and it's too small for freedom.~
@5875 = ~Free men. That's all I wanted to see in this place. Desperate fools who took any job they could get. But there's no sense buying what you can take, is there? No sense.~
@5876 = ~I'm glad you did that. Helping those slaves, drowning their prison.~
@5877 = ~Anyone would have.~
@5878 = ~Finally coming around on me, are you?~
@5879 = ~I didn't do it for your praise.~
@5880 = ~If you really think that's true, I feel sorry for you. And I envy you. But you're probably just saying it.~
@5881 = ~Maybe. Don't know your reasons, but it hardly matters. Result's the same.~
@5882 = ~Then I'm even more glad.~
@5883 = ~Lost more than their freedom, though. Too bad you can't give the rest back.~
@5884 = ~Perhaps not. But we've given them the chance to find it again.~
@5885 = ~I can't fix every one of every person's problems, Moidre.~
@5886 = ~I didn't expect you to care so much.~
@5887 = ~Not we. You. You did that. I'm just here.~
@5888 = ~Don't expect you to. Just saying.~
@5889 = ~Not sure I did either.~
@5890 = ~Why what?~
@5891 = ~Because.~
@5892 = ~Be quiet.~
@5893 = ~Why drown those people? What did they do to you?~
@5894 = ~Those mines had to go, and I wasn't going to spend my hard-earned gold just to spare a few slaves.~
@5895 = ~It sounded like fun. And it was! Didn't you see that man's face when he realised we lied?~
@5896 = ~Does it matter?~
@5897 = ~Why didn't you stop me?~
@5898 = ~You could have warned them. Give them some kind of chance. What would that have cost you?~
@5899 = ~Time and patience. Those people meant nothing to me, nor should they to you.~
@5900 = ~The amusement of seeing them all die, obviously.~
@5901 = ~If you found it so objectionable, why didn't you stop me?~
@5902 = ~I've never known a monster so honest.~
@5903 = ~That's right, and you never will. I know what I am, and I have the spine to admit it.~
@5904 = ~What are you trying to tell me here?~
@5905 = ~I'm a pragmatist, Moidre. You know damn well there's worse than me out there.~
@5906 = ~If you don't like it, go.~
@5907 = ~It doesn't matter. However you justify it, it won't give those people their lives back.~
@5908 = ~Would you have listened?~
@5909 = ~Depends on what you said.~
@5910 = ~I never asked why you didn't convince me. Why didn't you *stop* me?~
@5911 = ~I'll do what I swore to do, <CHARNAME>. Anyone tries to kill you, I'll fight them. And that's it. Never ask me for anything else.~
@5912 = ~I have permission?~
@5913 = ~Of course you don't. You thought I was serious? Get back in line.~
@5914 = ~No. You wouldn't have. If you have it in you to do something like that, nothing I said would've made a difference.~
@5915 = ~I...I made an oath. Guards who turn on their ward are less than worthless. ~
@5916 = ~You're releasing me from the oath. I don't have to protect you anymore.~
@5917 = ~Of course I'm not. You thought I was serious? Get back in line.~
@5918 = ~Don't try to make this my fault. You did it. Even if I should have stopped you, YOU DID IT.~
@5919 = ~And you're an accomplice. Deal with it.~
@5920 = ~Whenever you're done whining, let me know.~
@5921 = ~If it bothers you so much, you can go.~
@5922 = ~You're making a fair name for yourself.~
@5923 = ~I'm just trying to do what's right.~
@5924 = ~I couldn't have done it without you.~
@5925 = ~Do you approve?~
@5926 = ~It's always better to make friends than enemies.~
@5927 = ~Not just trying. Succeeding.~
@5928 = ~Yeah you could've. See it clearer every day. You don't need me.~
@5929 = ~Getting hard to say I don't.~
@5930 = ~But you are making enemies. Can't do the right thing these days without stepping on someone's toes.~
@5931 = ~I thought you just wanted the fame at first. Free drinks and a hero's discount. Been waiting to see what's hiding beneath it all.~
@5932 = ~But I keep coming back to what you did for those slaves. Paid out of your own pocket, risked drowning, and I can't figure out what you stood to gain.~
@5933 = ~Why are you always looking for a hidden agenda?~
@5934 = ~Being able to live with myself is a fair gain.~
@5935 = ~Gold is heavy. And I always enjoy a good swim.~
@5936 = ~Spotting danger's part of the job. Nothing's more dangerous than ulterior motives.~
@5937 = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@5938 = ~Can I trust you?~
@5939 = ~Of course you can.~
@5940 = ~Trust me to do what?~
@5941 = ~Nope! I break promises like eggs.~
@5942 = ~Don't answer like it's a small question.~
@5943 = ~To be what you seem to be.~
@5944 = ~Don't be flippant. Look at me. ~
@5945 = ~Words are just words. I know that. But if you say it, really say it, at least I have something to hold you to.~
@5946 = ~I won't disappoint you. You have my word.~
@5947 = ~I don't know if I can make that kind of promise.~
@5948 = ~No. You can't.~
@5949 = ~...alright. Can't ask much more than that.~
@5950 = ~Then you're honest. Still more than I'd hoped.~
@5951 = ~I want to believe I'm protecting something good. Just for a little while. Please don't let me down.~
@5952 = ~Here it is. Finally. The face behind the mask.~
@5953 = ~Had me fooled, <CHARNAME>. You really did. Swore I'd never be fooled again, and you went and made me betray myself. Of all the lying bastards I've worked for, you lie the best.~
@5954 = ~It's just a setback, Moidre. I'll be back to heroics in no time.~
@5955 = ~Yeah. Only temporary, right? Just for now. Just until you get through this. We all have to bend sometimes.~
@5956 = ~Heard it all before. Once was enough.~
@5957 = ~Call it what you like. Doesn't matter. Nothing you say matters anymore.~
@5958 = ~Nothing. I think you know that. Think that's why you dropped the facade. I'm just a fighter. That's all I am, all I'll ever be. And I can't fight you because I swore I wouldn't.~
@5959 = ~I'll uphold my oath. It's all I can do. And from now on, it's all I will do. Don't expect anything else.~
@5960 = ~<CHARNAME>, before we go in there, I need a word.~
@5961 = ~What about?~
@5962 = ~Not now. Let's get this done.~
@5963 = ~Come aside. Won't take long.~
@5964 = ~There are only two outcomes here. Either I help you win this fight, or I die trying. I'm ready for either one.~
@5965 = ~If I do fall, I don't expect you to remember me. Not even sure I want you to. Might be for the best if my time in this world was just forgotten. But you'll remember anyway, I think, whether I want it or not. Whether I expect it or not. So...~
@5966 = ~Remember this. Let the memory be a face, not just a shadow behind a visor.~
@5967 = ~I remember people by their deeds and their character, Moidre. You'll be more than just a face.~
@5968 = ~Come now, no talk of what will happen if we die. This isn't the day.~
@5969 = ~Agh, my memory for faces is terrible. It's so much easier thinking of you as a walking suit of armour.~
@5970 = ~First a bath, now the helmet? I half expect to see you singing and dancing at this rate.~
@5971 = ~If that's true, I hope I live. I'm not proud of my character or my deeds, <CHARNAME>, but if I have enough time...maybe someday, I can be.~
@5972 = ~If I have anything to say about it, no. It isn't.~
@5973 = ~That's fair. Most of my life, that's all I've been.~
@5974 = ~Not in your lifetime. I'll swear another oath on it.~
@5975 = ~How do I...how do I look?~
@5976 = ~Beautiful, in your own way. Although your hair's a disaster.~
@5977 = ~Normal. Just a normal woman. It's a bit disappointing after building up all that mystery.~
@5978 = ~Gods, no wonder you wear that thing all day. You're hideous.~
@5979 = ~I never thought I'd hear that question from you, of all people.~
@5980 = ~I'll have to take your word. Don't even remember myself anymore. All I'd see in a mirror is a stranger.~
@5981 = ~Just curiosity. It's been so long, I'm not even sure I'd recognise myself anymore. Thought I might as well give myself some idea.~
@5982 = ~Doesn't matter.~
@5983 = ~Won't kill Sarevok with my looks.~
@5984 = ~Hm?~
@5985 = ~Do you have any ideas as to what's affecting the local iron?~
@5986 = ~Could I impose on you to bathe?~
@5987 = ~Don't you ever take that helmet off?~
@5988 = ~I can't help noticing you have a beard.~
@5989 = ~It's refreshing to see a dwarven woman wear her beard so proudly.~
@5990 = ~Why not investigate the mines yourself? You're a strong fighter; you could easily round up a group and take care of it.~
@5991 = ~Why didn't you investigate the mines yourself? You're a strong fighter; you could easily have rounded up a group and taken care of it.~
@5992 = ~Any suggestions on what to do next?~
@5993 = ~You didn't have much gold when I met you. Has business been slow?~
@5994 = ~I'd like to hear more about these past jobs of yours.~
@5995 = ~Where are you from, Moidre?~
@5996 = ~Were you born sullen or did you grow into it?~
@5997 = ~What do you do when you need to cut your hair?~
@5998 = ~I don't understand why you're still travelling with me.~
@5999 = ~You don't seem to think very highly of yourself.~
@6000 = ~What do you do when you're not working?~
@6001 = ~Were you a slave?~
@6002 = ~Don't you object to fighting the Flaming Fist for me?~
@6003 = ~You've a bit more bounce in your step lately.~
@6004 = ~What happened to your clan, in the end?~
@6005 = ~So what sets a half-duergar apart from a full one?~
@6006 = ~If you could do absolutely anything else with your life, what would it be?~
@6007 = ~If you do manage to find those slaves, do you think they'll recognise you?~
@6008 = ~Can I get my soap back now?~
@6009 = ~Moidre, Gorion's letter said I'm part of Alaundo's prophecy. I'm one of Bhaal's children.~
@6010 = ~Those shield lessons you're giving Ajantis. Is that really what dwarves are taught?~
@6011 = ~I can't believe Alora actually got you to smile.~
@6012 = ~Would you really fight your own friends and family for me?~
@6013 = ~That poison rain thing didn't actually happen, did it?~
@6014 = ~I take it you don't trust Montaron.~
@6015 = ~Don't make Minsc think too hard. It hurts to watch.~
@6016 = ~You didn't need to threaten Neera like that.~
@6017 = ~It sounds like Rasaad's making a believer out of you.~
@6018 = ~That perfume is intoxicating on you.~
@6019 = ~Why so sensitive about the beard?~
@6020 = ~I think Skie's a lost cause.~
@6021 = ~Why do you care about Viconia?~
@6022 = ~So much for cheering Xan up, eh?~
@6023 = ~If @117 /* Moidre */ is just your clan name, what's your actual name?~
@6024 = ~Want a drink, Moidre?~
@6025 = ~Fine.~
@6026 = ~You're not dead yet. That's my metric. Doing fine.~
@6027 = ~Just keep doing what you're doing, <CHARNAME>. I've got your back.~
@6028 = ~You asking because I'm a dwarf?~
@6029 = ~I wasn't going to say it, but...~
@6030 = ~It just seemed like you knew something about it.~
@6031 = ~You're not the first. Live underground, everyone takes you for a mining expert.~
@6032 = ~It's sabotage. Only answer that makes sense. Someone looking to invade or monopolise. Couldn't say who, though.~
@6033 = ~You think Amn might be involved?~
@6034 = ~Is there some way to counteract it?~
@6035 = ~What makes you say that? Maybe the iron in that mine is just going bad.~
@6036 = ~Dunno. Don't pay attention to politics. Nothing good down that road.~
@6037 = ~Stop whoever's doing it. Otherwise, no. Un-corroding the iron would be like trying to un-burn wood.~
@6038 = ~It's not a crop. It doesn't get diseases. Only thing that can make iron crumble like that is bad smiths or bad doings.~
@6039 = ~Could you impose on me to take off my armour, put down my weapons and leave myself unable to do my job?~
@6040 = ~For what? Luxury? If I'm not on guard, I'm not earning my keep.~
@6041 = ~What keep? I'm not paying you a wage.~
@6042 = ~I'm not going to drop dead because you relaxed for a few minutes.~
@6043 = ~I order you to remove it.~
@6044 = ~It seems like you're hiding something.~
@6045 = ~Habit, then.~
@6046 = ~Maybe. Rather not test it.~
@6047 = ~No. I swore to protect, not obey.~
@6048 = ~My skull. From arrows.~
@6049 = ~Dwarves have beards.~
@6050 = ~But you're a woman.~
@6051 = ~Even female dwarves? I didn't know that.~
@6052 = ~Wasn't that uncommon where I came from. When we leave dwarven territory, that's when the razors come out. Most other races can't handle bearded women. Spares you a lot of questions, a lot of awkwardness, and a lot of bad jokes.~
@6053 = ~None of which bothers you, obviously.~
@6054 = ~Bah. Let them choke on it, I say.~
@6055 = ~*I* know how to handle a bearded woman.~
@6056 = ~Speaking of which, have you heard the one about-~
@6057 = ~Gets annoying sometimes. Just happens less when you're holding a hammer.~
@6058 = ~If I asked someone to follow me into a "demon" infested hole, you think they'd do it?~
@6059 = ~Of course they would.~
@6060 = ~Maybe if you presented yourself better.~
@6061 = ~Probably not, no.~
@6062 = ~You've a bad eye for leadership.~
@6063 = ~What you see is what you get. Prefer it that way. Nobody gets confused.~
@6064 = ~Some take orders, some give them. I'm a taker, and I don't play make-believe.~
@6065 = ~Nope.~
@6066 = ~Nothing at all?~
@6067 = ~ Thank you. Your input is invaluable.~
@6068 = ~You make decisions, I make sure they don't get you killed.~
@6069 = ~Below average. Like I said, crisis made life more expensive. Smiths charging more. Some think ironclad guards will just make them more of a target.~
@6070 = ~Besides, there's food and drink to cover. Mostly drink.~
@6071 = ~How is it possible to drink that much gold away?~
@6072 = ~You'd be a lot wealthier for a little abstinence.~
@6073 = ~No long-term plans? No investments?~
@6074 = ~Don't know many dwarves, do you?~
@6075 = ~Wealth to spend on what? Better drink? Nothing worth splurging on in human bars. All just means to the end of making life more bearable.~
@6076 = ~Don't like thinking long term. Too depressing. Makes my headache worse.~
@6077 = ~To get a better measure of who I'm working with.~
@6078 = ~It sounds like you've done things I disagree with. I may not be able to travel with you in good conscience.~
@6079 = ~I enjoy a good, bloody story.~
@6080 = ~Not much in them to measure.~
@6081 = ~Do you disagree with me fighting for you? Long as I'm here, that's all I'm doing.~
@6082 = ~Even so, I think it'd best to hear about them. It'd give me a better measure of you.~
@6083 = ~That's not the point. I can't shelter a criminal.~
@6084 = ~Stop stonewalling and tell me.~
@6085 = ~You're not. I'm sheltering you. That's the arrangement. Besides, I could tell you a dozen stories and the most you could accuse me of is standing by.~
@6086 = ~I'm not stonewalling. Just not much to tell.~
@6087 = ~Won't enjoy these, then.~
@6088 = ~Lot of the time, nothing happens. I'm just a presence. People see me and don't do things they would've done otherwise.~
@6089 = ~So tell me about a time when something did happen.~
@6090 = ~That sounds boring.~
@6091 = ~There was a fight.~
@6092 = ~What kind of fight?~
@6093 = ~Did you win?~
@6094 = ~Boring is good. I don't find trouble. I keep it from finding us.~
@6095 = ~Some people died.~
@6096 = ~A short one.~
@6097 = ~Don't know what you want me to say. Someone attacks my clients, I don't stop to ask who they are.~
@6098 = ~Maybe you should try it.~
@6099 = ~You're a very confusing person.~
@6100 = ~Well. Since I'm your client now, it's good to know you won't be hesitating.~
@6101 = ~Moidre, any mercenary would ask for some kind of information up front. Who they're going to be fighting, how many...~
@6102 = ~Even if they feel like answering, there are three outcomes. They leave, they die, or I die. Doesn't matter in any of them.~
@6103 = ~Or you're not used to simplicity.~
@6104 = ~Right. You want to learn anything about me, let it be that.~
@6105 = ~Did I ask you?~
@6106 = ~You should have!~
@6107 = ~But did I?~
@6108 = ~It matters to me.~
@6109 = ~No. I'm just curious.~
@6110 = ~No it doesn't. My past isn't what protects you.~
@6111 = ~Don't be. Nothing worth curiosity.~
@6112 = ~You've watched me fight, and I'm not fighting you. You know what you need to.~
@6113 = ~But how did you become a mercenary? And why?~
@6114 = ~Good relationships aren't formed on a need-to-know basis.~
@6115 = ~Fine. I wasn't that interested anyway.~
@6116 = ~Because I know how to fight.~
@6117 = ~Don't need a good relationship to do my job.~
@6118 = ~Ever read a book where they go on and on about the day's weather or the colour of someone's eyes? Ever catch yourself not caring? That's because it's not the story. It's details. Fat.~
@6119 = ~My book's got a lot of fat. The meat is, someone starts something, I hit them until it stops. The end.~
@6120 = ~A little fat can add flavour, though.~
@6121 = ~Why are you so guarded?~
@6122 = ~Forget it. I don't know why I bothered.~
@6123 = ~Not this fat. Rubber and gristle.~
@6124 = ~Job.~
@6125 = ~Me neither.~
@6126 = ~Dwarf.~
@6127 = ~Wait till I'm not on contract. Buy myself a room, sturdy door. Lock it. Barricade it. Check the wardrobe and under the bed. Then a second or two with a sharp knife gets it done. Not like it has to be pretty.~
@6128 = ~How much more neurotic can you get?~
@6129 = ~Damn. Here I was about to ask you for styling tips.~
@6130 = ~At that point, why even bother?~
@6131 = ~Tried an invisibility potion once. Gets harder when you can't see what you're cutting, though. That left a mark.~
@6132 = ~No amount of primping survives a helmet. Even I know that.~
@6133 = ~When it's growing over your eyes, enough is enough.~
@6134 = ~People still out for your blood, far as I can tell. Job's not over yet.~
@6135 = ~But I'm not paying you. There's no contract. What's keeping you here?~
@6136 = ~People could be out for my blood for the rest of my life.~
@6137 = ~I admire your dedication.~
@6138 = ~Oath aside? Nothing. But nothing's pushing me away either.~
@6139 = ~If they are, "the rest of your life" mightn't be long.~
@6140 = ~Not dedication. Inertia.~
@6141 = ~My work's all the same. Doesn't matter who it's for. Always the same. Go somewhere, look scary, thump anything that doesn't think I'm scary enough.~
@6142 = ~You haven't asked me to do anything ugly yet. Adventuring covers expenses. Don't fix what isn't broken.~
@6143 = ~You're no worse than my other prospects. Adventuring covers expenses. Don't fix what isn't broken.~
@6144 = ~Should I?~
@6145 = ~I'm a decent fighter. Might be proud of that if anything good ever came of it. Otherwise...~
@6146 = ~What comes out of it is entirely up to you.~
@6147 = ~You're an *excellent* fighter.~
@6148 = ~If you worked hard to get good at something, you deserve to be proud. Who cares what comes of it?~
@6149 = ~You're more than that. You're dependable, loyal, honest...~
@6150 = ~Actually, I agree. You're a completely expendable grunt. I just wanted to remind you.~
@6151 = ~Not that simple. Just because you think you're doing something doesn't mean you are.~
@6152 = ~Could be the best fighter in the world. Makes no difference if the fight's crooked.~
@6153 = ~I do. Rather be a bad fighter with a good cause than a good fighter with a bad one. But we don't get to choose what we are.~
@6154 = ~Hah. Only because I haven't the sense to be anything else.~
@6155 = ~Hadn't forgotten.~
@6156 = ~You might say I'm doing good protecting you, but how would I know? Maybe those people after you are in the right.~
@6157 = ~Do you really believe that?~
@6158 = ~But I've done so many good things!~
@6159 = ~Pfft. What do you mean "maybe"?~
@6160 = ~If I have to worry about you siding with my enemies, you can leave right now.~
@6161 = ~Dunno. Only got your word. That's my point.~
@6162 = ~Since we met. What about before? And why did you do them? No way of telling.~
@6163 = ~You being wrong doesn't make your enemies right. Sometimes they're just a different kind of wrong.~
@6164 = ~You don't. I swore an oath. That's what I go by. Only thing I can be sure of.~
@6165 = ~Look for work. Or drink. Can usually do both in the same place, so it works out.~
@6166 = ~What do you *like* to do, then? Apart from drink.~
@6167 = ~Nobody can spend every waking hour either working or finding work. You'd go insane. There must be something else.~
@6168 = ~Your life is dismal, isn't it?~
@6169 = ~Not sure I even like that. More of an occupational necessity.~
@6170 = ~Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.~
@6171 = ~Finally noticed?~
@6172 = ~So maybe I am.~
@6173 = ~You were pretty upset by what we saw in the Cloakwood mines.~
@6174 = ~People get upset by lots of things. ~
@6175 = ~You don't.~
@6176 = ~But you seem to shrug everything else off. Only the slavery bothered you.~
@6177 = ~Are you being evasive?~
@6178 = ~I do. You just don't notice.~
@6179 = ~Shrug what off? The violence? Didn't always. Just got used to it. Show me enough slaves, I'll get used to that too. Not that I want to.~
@6180 = ~I'm not a slave. Never have been. But I've seen slavery before and it shouldn't happen. That's all.~
@6181 = ~No. I was there. You didn't do it.~
@6182 = ~Well. On one hand, you did kill Rieltar. Other hand, what we've seen, he had it coming. Either way, I've got an oath to keep. I'm doing my job, same as them.~
@6183 = ~I know you don't deserve to die. Could be they don't either, but I'll take definitely over maybe.~
@6184 = ~You're seeing things. Nobody bounces in armour, especially not dwarves.~
@6185 = ~You're talking in complete sentences more often too.~
@6186 = ~It's subtle, but by your standards you're practically skipping.~
@6187 = ~You really shouldn't feed people's prejudices like that.~
@6188 = ~Soon fix that.~
@6189 = ~Armour's wearing in, maybe. Always get a bit more spry when it doesn't feel like a weight anymore.~
@6190 = ~Why not? If people assume you're always grumpy, they don't start asking questions when you actually are. "She's just being a dwarf." Saves a lot of time.~
@6191 = ~We pushed too hard, took too many. Someone was bound to notice. There'd been rumours about where the ore was coming from, and once the people we'd wronged came knocking, they stopped being rumours.~
@6192 = ~Half the clan supported our leader. Either didn't believe it or didn't care. Other half revolted. Half and half. Even sides. No winners.~
@6193 = ~In the end it was just me, him, and the last of the rebels beating down his door. I turned, yelled at him to run, that I'd hold them off, but he already had a dagger in his own heart.~
@6194 = ~They saw me standing over his body, and...I suppose they assumed I'd done it. Probably would have killed me otherwise. Probably would have let them. ~
@6195 = ~Can't turn invisible, can't double in size. Probably can't see through illusions either, though I haven't dealt with enough mages to know.~
@6196 = ~That, and when a *half* duergar's born, a dwarf clan doesn't put it a sack and take it to the nearest river. Just barely, mind you.~
@6197 = ~And what sets you apart from an everyday dwarf?~
@6198 = ~That's a pretty bad deal.~
@6199 = ~Suppose I can hold my drink better, but that just means drinking's more expensive. Lightweights don't know how good they have it.~
@6200 = ~Don't I know it.~
@6201 = ~Only saving grace is I don't burn up in the sun. Least, no more than anyone who wears metal all day.~
@6202 = ~Smithing?~
@6203 = ~No. Something else. Something without any hammering.~
@6204 = ~Gardening.~
@6205 = ~You want to be a *gardener*?~
@6206 = ~Oh. I was hoping for something exciting.~
@6207 = ~What would you grow?~
@6208 = ~I want to keep something alive without having to kill anyone to do it.~
@6209 = ~What would you call exciting? Travelling? Fighting? Done enough of those.~
@6210 = ~Hops, maybe. Get a little brewery going on the side. My own custom ales, for all the dwarves in human lands who can't find a decent drink anymore. Let the first batch go for free, as a toast to lost clans...~
@6211 = ~*sigh* Now you've got me thinking about what could have been.~
@6212 = ~Only thing they'd remember is the helmet. I'll wear a different one. Don't want them knowing who I am up front, or they won't follow me. But once they're safe, I'll...~
@6213 = ~I'll tell them. Everything. They'd call me a hero otherwise, and I couldn't bear that.~
@6214 = ~You don't want it back. Trust me. I'll buy you a new one.~
@6215 = ~Does that terminate our agreement?~
@6216 = ~Then I didn't need to know it.~
@6217 = ~Fine. Let's make a new one.~
@6218 = ~You're the only person I've worked for who's worth a damn, <CHARNAME>. I'm not going anywhere unless that changes.~
@6219 = ~Always. I'm a dwarf, you know what to get.~
@6220 = ~Do you? Think it's time I got some rounds in.~
@6221 = ~Girdle?~
@6222 = ~It's what I was taught. Don't know about everyone else.~
@6223 = ~You're worth more than your shield, Moidre.~
@6224 = ~Well, it certainly worked for you.~
@6225 = ~Could you teach me as well?~
@6226 = ~It all sounds like hogwash to me.~
@6227 = ~Am I? If someone switched me with a dwarf-shaped golem, would you notice?~
@6228 = ~Yes. I would.~
@6229 = ~It'd probably be more talkative.~
@6230 = ~I might not, honestly.~
@6231 = ~No, it works for other people. That's the point.~
@6232 = ~No. If you do what I do, it defeats the purpose.~
@6233 = ~'Course it does. You keep yourself alive, I keep other people alive. Different jobs, different techniques.~
@6234 = ~Only at mealtime.~
@6235 = ~Right. My line of work, it doesn't matter who you are. Just how you fight.~
@6236 = ~Ehh. Throw enough crap at a wall, something'll stick.~
@6237 = ~Besides, she had an advantage. Nobody's ever tried to do it before..~
@6238 = ~Yes. Not that it makes a difference anymore.~
@6239 = ~Not literally. Don't rule it out, though. Mages are tricky.~
@6240 = ~Gonna hurt even more if he has to make a sacrifice he's not prepared for. Not everything always works out for the best. In fact, it usually doesn't. Best break him in gently.~
@6241 = ~Don't trust much of anyone. He just happened to bring it up.~
@6242 = ~I'd say boot him, but if you've any sense, you've already thought about it. ~
@6243 = ~He's treacherous, but he's not stupid. He won't turn on us as long as our goals are the same.~
@6244 = ~I'd rather have him where I can see him.~
@6245 = ~So far I've got no more reason to suspect him than you.~
@6246 = ~I haven't, actually.~
@6247 = ~Sooner or later they won't be the same. Wouldn't count on him telling you when.~
@6248 = ~I don't need to know the reason. Long as you have one.~
@6249 = ~Wrong. I might be working for someone else. He's definitely working for someone else.~
@6250 = ~Do. I've got eyes in the back of my head, but the helmet's in the way.~
@6251 = ~Not threatening. Warning.~
@6252 = ~I don't want to kill her. That's why I told her, so she'd know to run.~
@6253 = ~Eh. Still dubious.~
@6254 = ~"None who would embrace Selune are turned away." Pretty words, but nothing's tested them yet.  He had one good thing happen to him and forgot how many bastards there are in the world.~
@6255 = ~Joking, sincere, don't care. Ignoring it.~
@6256 = ~Back where I lived, one of the ollams said there were two things every dwarf should have a right to. The hair on their chins, and the support of their clan.~
@6257 = ~I've only got one. Have to hold on to it.~
@6258 = ~No doubt. But she'll find out eventually. Then she'll know to listen next time.~
@6259 = ~I know what it's like to feel you don't have a place.~
@6260 = ~She might deserve a little help. Might not. Dunno what she did before she came topside. I do know I wouldn't wish that feeling on most people, and she's not made herself an exception yet.~
@6261 = ~Nah. Jostled something, I think. Went almost a whole evening afterwards without saying the word "doomed." New record for him.~
@6262 = ~Not important. You just need something to call me. You won't meet another Moidre, so Moidre will do.~
@6263 = ~What do you think we should do next?~
@6264 = ~Still sulking, I see.~
@6265 = ~I can't help noticing you're not fighting as hard.~
@6266 = ~Don't care.~
@6267 = ~Is there a fight?~
@6268 = ~Not right at this moment, no.~
@6269 = ~There's no reason we can't still be friends.~
@6270 = ~There might be if this keeps up.~
@6271 = ~Nothing to talk about, then.~
@6272 = ~"Still."~
@6273 = ~I'll be ready for it.~
@6274 = ~May I ask why?~
@6275 = ~Perhaps we could do something about that?~
@6276 = ~Get your act together or you're gone.~
@6277 = ~I'm tired.~
@6278 = ~You can't.~
@6279 = ~Bad incentive.~
@6280 = ~This temporary? Need to know if I should make other arrangements.~
@6281 = ~Meet me back at the Red Sheaf. Preferably sober.~
@6282 = ~Just wait here. I'll be back soon.~
@6283 = ~It's so temporary, it's already over. Back in line.~
@6284 = ~I'm always sober. Not for lack of effort.~
@6285 = ~Don't rush for my sake.~
@6286 = ~What's the matter? Thought we were seeing this through.~
@6287 = ~I'll meet you back at the Red Sheaf.~
@6288 = ~We are. So let's get moving.~
@6289 = ~Don't get killed.~
@6290 = ~I'm ready for you to join me again.~
@6291 = ~Just checking you're still here.~
@6292 = ~Hail there. Don't cause trouble and you needn't mind me.~
@6293 = ~You look more like a warrior than a priest.~
@6294 = ~Would you believe I used to be a paladin? Tormite, no less. Duty this, obedience that. I wiped out a Zhentarim cabal in Scornubel, down to the last man. I led a charge against the orcs of Muranndin, killed their leader in single combat.~
@6295 = ~Then I found out some buttery little bastard had been two-timing my daughter. Three-timing, actually. I went over to knock a couple of teeth out, and the silly bugger falls and cracks his head on the balustrade. Dead.~
@6296 = ~And there goes my knighthood. Loyalty is the most important thing in the world, but twenty years of it doesn't excuse one accident, apparently. Well he can stick it, the tightarse.~
@6297 = ~Keep those weapons holstered, folks. I stand where I can see everyone for a reason.~
@6298 = ~I'm watching that bastard. First excuse he gives me...~
@6299 = ~Have to admit, this is a cleaner fix than anything I'd have done. Still want a piece of Taranis, but whatever. I'll take it out on the next lot of bandits.~
@6300 = ~'Ey up. Good to have some new blood in here. Figuratively speaking, of course.~
@6301 = ~Phil! How's the wife?~
@6302 = ~Clueless!~
@6303 = ~Gets me out of the house. Heh, the wife thinks I'm off selling her homemade "good luck charms". They're all the rage in Amn, I told her. Really, I just toss 'em in the river and bring home some Talassan plunder. Couldn't flog that tat to a tat collector.~
@6304 = ~Crackin' scones, Kelly. Mind if I swipe a couple for the kids?~
@6305 = ~Of course not, Phil! Take one for your wife as well.~
@6306 = ~Nah love, she's fat enough already!~
@6307 = ~How'd this prat get the better of Stormlord Jeff? I bet he waited till his back was turned. Bloody disgrace, this is.~
@6308 = ~What a plonker.~
@6309 = ~That's it? "Go and bring me some presents"? And not a hint as to what he actually wanted. What sort of leadership is that?~
@6310 = ~He didn't even touch the scones! After all the trouble I went to! Ooh, I could just...just...smite someone!~
@6311 = ~Let's do it. I gutted twelve a tenday of him in my paladin years. With the rest of you backing me up-~
@6312 = ~No, Pam.~
@6313 = ~Why not?! Give him what he gave Stormlord Jeff!~
@6314 = ~And cost Talos another priest? Besides, as soon as the Athkatlans found out, they'd just send someone else. Probably with reinforcements.~
@6315 = ~So what we gonna do, then? We can't let him kick us out our own temple! That's my second home, that is!~
@6316 = ~I'll take care of it. In the meantime, I want everyone concentrating on the local bandits. Nobody should be reaving out here but us, and it's about time we put our foot down and our boot in. Alright?~
@6317 = ~Bandit-stomping. Ah, nostalgia.~
@6318 = ~Yeah. Yeah, that's good. I could just do with chastening some heathens about now.~
@6319 = ~I'm coming too. Does anyone have a spare mace?~
@6320 = ~I wish I could be there when Taranis gets home and has to tell Weathermaster Whoever he got his arse kicked.~
@6321 = ~Mustn't be disturbed, old chap. Danger on the horizon, don't you know.~
@6322 = ~Mustn't be disturbed, my dear lady. Danger on the horizon, don't you know.~
@6323 = ~Just as well. I've an appointment at the Three Old Kegs, and I'm long overdue.~
@6324 = ~Appointment? With whom?~
@6325 = ~He has many names, but I'll tell you this much; he's stout, dark, and occasionally bitter.~
@6326 = ~Ah, indeed. I may just have to join you. And if these fine folks are as capable as they look, we'll...~
@6327 = ~I say. Isn't that one of yours, Pierson?~
@6328 = ~Beg pardon?~
@6329 = ~That...charmingly rustic halfling lass. She has one of your crossbows. Seems your work transcends class, eh?~
@6330 = ~One of his?~
@6331 = ~Uncanny, isn't it? Look at her stance. Those eyes. With some decent clothes and a hairbrush...~
@6332 = ~Plunkett, you devil! If I didn't know better, I'd say she was-~
@6333 = ~Dad?!~
@6334 = ~Hello, er...~
@6335 = ~Plunkett! Pierson Plunkett! That's my dad! You're my dad!~
@6336 = ~So it would seem. You...you look well.~
@6337 = ~You're supposed to be dead!~
@6338 = ~Ah. Yes. Well. If you'll allow me a moment to-~
@6339 = ~You bastard! You utter BASTARD!~
@6340 = ~Excuse you! I'm sure you weren't raised to use such language!~
@6341 = ~HOW THE BLOODY HELL WOULD YOU KNOW?!~
@6342 = ~Er, Pierson?~
@6343 = ~Not now, Aldeth.~
@6344 = ~Trespassers and butchers of our-~
@6345 = ~Listen to me, young lady. Regardless of any history between us, I am still your father, and-~
@6346 = ~We ain't got any sodding history! That's the problem here!~
@6347 = ~Excuse me.~
@6348 = ~*I am still your father*, and you'll use a more civil tone with me.~
@6349 = ~*Excuse* me.~
@6350 = ~Civil?! You're lucky I ain't belted you, you lying toe rag!~
@6351 = ~NOT to interrupt, but-~
@6352 = ~Now see here! I refuse to stand before my peers and have a shrieking contest in the middle of the forest like a pair of baboons!~
@6353 = ~I don't give one lonely toss about your-~
@6354 = ~EXCUSE! ME!~
@6355 = ~What?! What do you want?! Can't you see we're in the middle of something?!~
@6356 = ~I am not having company to<DAYNIGHT>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. This is between me and my drink.~
@6357 = ~You found me.~
@6358 = ~Practically told us where you'd be, didn't you? You think I wouldn't come looking?~
@6359 = ~Perhaps...or perhaps I wished to leave it in your hands.~
@6360 = ~I expect you're here for some sort of explanation? Or is it simply to berate me again? ~
@6361 = ~Probably both. But let's go in that order.~
@6362 = ~Well...are you sure your friend should be here for this?~
@6363 = ~<CHARNAME>? I don't mind if <PRO_HESHE> don't.~
@6364 = ~I'll stay. We don't want him running off again.~
@6365 = ~This isn't for my ears. Let's just spend the night and you two can catch up.~
@6366 = ~Quite so. An embarrassing lapse on my part, but when I realised who you were...I'd never been so frightened in my entire life.~
@6367 = ~You weren't unwanted. Let me make that perfectly clear. By the time you were due, your mother and I were lying awake every night, making silly bets over whether you'd be a boy or a girl, if you'd have her eyes or mine. We had more rows over what to name you than we did everything else put together. She even took up carpentry so she could build your crib with her own...her own hands...~
@6368 = ~Dad?~
@6369 = ~Yes. Pardon me.~
@6370 = ~I'm afraid your mother didn't survive you. And I'm afraid I didn't quite survive losing her.~
@6371 = ~If she were here now, the first thing she'd tell you is that I drank too much. She told *everyone* I drank too much, and rightly so. But before she died, there was a time and a place for too much. Always a time and a place.~
@6372 = ~A month or so after her funeral, I sat by the fire with you in one hand and a bottle in the other. And I very nearly did something foolish.~
@6373 = ~I knew then, I didn't deserve something so precious. The thought of what might happen if I'd kept you, the life you would have had...~
@6374 = ~So you just went out and looked for some elves to foist me off on?~
@6375 = ~Of course not. Haven't you read my book? I had friends among that tribe. Real friends, who cared nothing for my wealth or my fame, who I respected more than any other.~
@6376 = ~And so I gave them you, my finest bow and my manuscript. The three things I cherished most. And I begged them to tell you I'd died, so you wouldn't wonder why.~
@6377 = ~I couldn't even name you, in the end. I don't know my own daughter's name.~
@6378 = ~*Littlun?*~
@6379 = ~Don't like it? Talk to them.~
@6380 = ~No, it's...that's what your mother would call you. Her littlun. It's what I called you, when I gave you to them. "Please look after my littlun." Hah. They misunderstood, obviously.~
@6381 = ~It's nice, though. Had I been a better man, I might have named you that myself. My Littlun.~
@6382 = ~Don't you start with that. What, I'm supposed to just say "That's alright, then"? Pretend we're a family now?~
@6383 = ~Give me your crossbow.~
@6384 = ~It's my greatest masterpiece, even now. But I've learned a thing or two since then. I believe I can make some adj...~
@6385 = ~No. I believe I can show you how to make some adjustments.~
@6386 = ~<CHARNAME>? I shall treat you and your company to the finest fare the Three Old Kegs has to offer, if I might only impose on you for some time with my daughter.~
@6387 = ~You have yourself a deal.~
@6388 = ~That's for her to decide.~
@6389 = ~We haven't an evening to spare right now. Perhaps later.~
@6390 = ~Alright. But you'd better be serious about the crossbow, or you'll get it back upside your bloody head.~
@6391 = ~There's too much we have to do, dad. But I'll come back. I will. And if you ain't here when I do, so help me...~
@6392 = ~Do I dare refuse? I shall be here, my daughter. There is nowhere else I would go than wherever I may see your face again.~
@6393 = ~I hope you you are taking good care of my daughter. Let her know that I will wait as long as need be.~
@6394 = ~Welcome back. Perhaps now is a better time to borrow my daughter from you? One day is all I ask.~
@6395 = ~As you wish. Let us rest here a while, and Littlun may go with you.~
@6396 = ~I fear we still have much to attend to. Another time.~
@6397 = ~Better?~
@6398 = ~*Much* better. I can barely pull the trigger fast enough.~
@6399 = ~Seems I'm still good for something, then. And here I thought that ended with you. But, ah, your friends are awake. They'll be wanting you back, no doubt.~
@6400 = ~Littlun. I know I've no right to ask, but do think about visiting. When you can.~
@6401 = ~If I do, I don't want to meet some drunken old fop. I want to meet the man who wrote this manuscript.~
@6402 = ~Hah. The man who wrote this manuscript *was* a drunken fop. Just not so old.~
@6403 = ~Do you want it back?~
@6404 = ~No. It isn't much to me now. Just parchment and memories and dust. But perhaps...~
@6405 = ~"The Progress of Projectiles, by Pierson and Littlun Plunkett." Wouldn't that be a fine book? I should certainly like to read that one day.~
@6406 = ~Well then. I myself have spent *quite* enough time with my cups, I fear. Far more than taverns out there for a Plunkett, eh?~
@6407 = ~Goodbye, my dear. And goodbye, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for the part you played in this. You may well have changed a man today.~
@6408 = ~Flara? By the gods! You're Flara, aren't you?~
@6409 = ~I see I'm regaining some infamy. Not that it matters until the tributes materialise.~
@6410 = ~What? What are you talking about? Flara, it's me!~
@6411 = ~Ugh. We've met, have we? I don't usually bother to remember mammals unless they owe me something.~
@6412 = ~It's Sigurd. Perhaps I've changed since I last saw you. You certainly have. But you must...you must remember. Surely. I'm a close friend of your family. Uncle Gurdie?~
@6413 = ~Hah! Not that there was any uncertainty to begin with, but that settles it. The day I refer to someone as "Uncle Gurdie" is a *long* time coming.~
@6414 = ~I'm afraid there are gaps in her memory, sir. You may have trouble getting through to her.~
@6415 = ~Sigurd, was it? Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?~
@6416 = ~You heard her. She doesn't know you. Get ye gone, whoever you are.~
@6417 = ~So it seems. The gods are seldom keen to make things simple for us.~
@6418 = ~Yes. I'd recognise that fiery hair anywhere. And her eyes, her voice, even the way she walks. It's all just as I remember. There is no mistake.~
@6419 = ~Pardon me, but who are *you*? I happen to care about this girl, and I won't turn my back at your say so.~
@6420 = ~The dragon, Flara. Do you remember the dragon?~
@6421 = ~Dragon?~
@6422 = ~Just before you went missing. Our home was attacked by a great red dragon. Your parents and I barely escaped with our lives.~
@6423 = ~The battlemages were out in force that day. So much magic in the air it made your hair stand on end. Perhaps there was some unexpected surge, something that affected your memory. I'm no wizard, but-~
@6424 = ~You're mistaken. If there is a red dragon in your story, I am she.~
@6425 = ~She's a dragon trapped in human form.~
@6426 = ~She thinks she's a dragon. Good luck.~
@6427 = ~I'll just let you two talk.~
@6428 = ~Flara. Listen to me. You are the daughter of Lord and Lady Burnheart. I've known your family since before you were born, and-~
@6429 = ~No. No more from you. I will not stand here and be told what I am or am not. Disappear before I take your ignorance as an insult.~
@6430 = ~Wait! Just give me one day. I'll speak with your parents, I'll ask them to bring some of your old belongings...you'll see. I swear you'll see.~
@6431 = ~Just consider it. Alright? One day, then meet me at the Friendly Arm Inn. That's all I ask. Please.~
@6432 = ~With all due respect, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I am not interested in you. I only want to see Flara.~
@6433 = ~Hah! There she is! And here you lot thought I was chasing geese!~
@6434 = ~Hrm. It's good you are well, my daughter.~
@6435 = ~Oh, my darling! My darling girl! How I've missed you!~
@6436 = ~Ah, nothing warms the soul like a mother's love for-~
@6437 = ~Get. Off.~
@6438 = ~W-What? But...~
@6439 = ~What is this? You assemble a few strangers and have them claim to know me? You clearly don't, if you think I'm so easily fooled.~
@6440 = ~You have to admit there's a resemblance.~
@6441 = ~This does seem hard to swallow.~
@6442 = ~At least give them a chance to prove themselves.~
@6443 = ~A superficial one at best. No doubt that's why he asked for a day. More time to find someone who looks the part.~
@6444 = ~Not so hard as "I'm secretly a polymorphed dragon." If I may be so bold, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@6445 = ~It isn't a secret.~
@6446 = ~No. All that interests me is the dragon this half-elf spoke of. I will hear of that, and then I will leave. If the information is useful, so will they.~
@6447 = ~Ah, yes. I did mention she seems a bit...confused. Not surprising, perhaps. Heaven knows what the poor girl's been through.~
@6448 = ~Flara. Enough. You're upsetting your mother. Stop this nonsense and come with us.~
@6449 = ~Do not DARE demand of me. You're on perilous ground as it is. The only reason I haven't burned you all for your lies is that I don't understand what you hope to gain from them.~
@6450 = ~My lord, I did bring some of the young mistress' possessions from the estate, as requested. Perhaps now is the time to present them?~
@6451 = ~*grunt*~
@6452 = ~Very good, my lord. Does the young mistress remember this statuette, perhaps? Her precious ruby dragon?~
@6453 = ~I've never imagined myself saying this, but I am not interested in your trinkets. All I want...~
@6454 = ~Wait. This is...how did you come by this?~
@6455 = ~It was all we found of you, my dear. You loved it so, we knew you would never willingly part with it.~
@6456 = ~They kept it for you, Flara. They kept it so they could give it back.~
@6457 = ~I do remember this. I always kept it close for...~
@6458 = ~Because...it...argh! Tiamat's breath! I know there was a reason!~
@6459 = ~Ah, you've always been fond of dragons. There wasn't a day I visited that I didn't hear some new and exciting dragon facts, how glorious they were, how much you wanted to be one...~
@6460 = ~I still recall the first story I told you, back when you weren't too big to sit on my knee. "Sir Marduk the Dragonslayer." Do you remember? You made me change the ending so that the dragon won.~
@6461 = ~Does any of this ring a bell, Flara?~
@6462 = ~Now that sounds exactly like her.~
@6463 = ~Yes yes, very interesting. How much is that statuette worth?~
@6464 = ~I don't believe it! I will never believe it! Liars, all of you, and thieves as well! Get out of my sight! Get out!~
@6465 = ~LISTEN HERE, YOU LITTLE-~
@6466 = ~*Lord Burnheart.*~
@6467 = ~I did warn you she might not accept it right away. Perhaps if we could show just a little more patience...?~
@6468 = ~It may be wisest to allow the young mistress her space. Just until she has calmed herself, my lord.~
@6469 = ~Please, Flara. We want our daughter back. Please try to remember.~
@6470 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. Forgive me for disturbing your rest. I wonder if we might have a word?~
@6471 = ~Certainly. What about?~
@6472 = ~While my party sleeps? I'm not sure I trust your intentions.~
@6473 = ~If you're trying to ambush me, you shouldn't have come alone.~
@6474 = ~Dear Flara, of course. What else? But before that, there are some people I'd like you to meet.~
@6475 = ~Fear not, friend. We needn't cross swords tonight. I'd just like you to meet some friends of mine.~
@6476 = ~Oh, it's not an ambush. But as it happens, I also didn't come alone.~
@6477 = ~This big lug here is Krakus. The lovely lady is Marina, and last but not least, we have Bignose Shortstack.~
@6478 = ~*Winkelried*. ~
@6479 = ~Beg pardon. Bignose Shortstack Winkelried, Esquire.~
@6480 = ~Mind you, you've met them before. Just not with those names, and thanks to a dash of Bignose magic, not with those faces. Allow me to introduce them again: Lord Burnheart, Lady Burnheart, and their trusty retainer Reeves.~
@6481 = ~And I'm still Sigurd. Just to be clear.~
@6482 = ~What is this? You lied to me?~
@6483 = ~I knew there was something off about you.~
@6484 = ~Explain yourself or I start killing.~
@6485 = ~Not to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Not intentionally. Just to her.~
@6486 = ~A canny gentle<PRO_MANWOMAN>! Good, good. Our offer should interest you, then.~
@6487 = ~Now now, let's not turn this sour. Our means are shadowy, but our cause is bright.~
@6488 = ~Flara has told you she's a dragon trapped in human form, yes? Madness. Clearly. Cyric himself would quirk a brow. But let us set common sense aside and pretend it's the truth.~
@6489 = ~If there were such a dragon, she'd have been doing as red dragons do. Terrorising villages, demanding tributes. Burning half of them anyway, just for merriment. And one day, someone would decide enough is enough.~
@6490 = ~So they'd seek out some courageous and enterprising fools. And those fools, knowing they'd be ripped to shreds by a dragon that size, would have to pursue alternative methods.~
@6491 = ~And how did you come by these alternative methods?~
@6492 = ~It's obvious it was you. Why are you trying to be mysterious?~
@6493 = ~Cowards.~
@6494 = ~A long story. You're in the business yourself, so I'm sure you know how it goes. It involves an underground ruin, undead guardians, half a dozen skull traps that I was *told* had been disarmed...~
@6495 = ~Necromancy isn't my forte!~
@6496 = ~I'm a bard! I'm obliged to carry myself with a certain dramatic flair, but if you're determined to be boring...~
@6497 = ~Realists. There's no shame in admitting when you're outmatched.~
@6498 = ~The point is, we found our answer. An ancient wand designed by drakonophobes. Only one charge left, alas, because that is always the way of things. But it did the job. Forced her into a human form, then muddled her memories so she wouldn't know how to change back. Ingenious bastards, these Netherese mages. Thoroughly so. On both counts.~
@6499 = ~If this wand of yours worked, how did she escape you?~
@6500 = ~What about that statuette you showed her?~
@6501 = ~If this is true, the magic's failing. She's getting scalier by the day.~
@6502 = ~I really don't care about this. Just tell me what you want.~
@6503 = ~Ah. Shall we say that Flara...subverted our narrative expectations?~
@6504 = ~We all imagined her announcing herself. A winged silhouette darkening the town, promising fiery death. Plenty of time for the rabble to panic and for us to prepare our trump card.~
@6505 = ~Instead, she sneaked through the gates in human form, transformed right in the middle of the square and gave us the worst thrashing of our lives before Bignose finally got the damned wand off. By the time Marina here managed to shove everyone's entrails back in, our quarry was gone.~
@6506 = ~The ruby dragon? She dropped it when the wand did its work.~
@6507 = ~It's enchanted to protect the bearer from cold, you see. A red dragon's one weakness. Once she knew that, I dare say she took it to bed with her.~
@6508 = ~Yes. Apparently our wandmaker didn't account for how stubborn dragons could be.~
@6509 = ~She still believes she's not a human, deep down. She knows. Therein lies the problem. No magic lasts forever. And as a dragon, she has plenty of willpower and plenty of time.~
@6510 = ~But not to worry! We can make this right, you and I. Because for whatever reason, she seems to listen to you. Certainly more than she does us. You, I think, can convince her to return to her loving family.~
@6511 = ~You don't think it's wrong to deceive her like this?~
@6512 = ~Couldn't you just kill her?~
@6513 = ~What do you intend to do with her?~
@6514 = ~Perhaps I can, but I won't. Whatever my companions may be, I'm not turning them over to a stranger.~
@6515 = ~And what's in this for me?~
@6516 = ~We'll pay you five hundred gold if you give us Flara. Short enough for you?~
@6517 = ~You have a deal.~
@6518 = ~(Lie) You have a deal.~
@6519 = ~Sorry, did I hear five hundred or one thousand? One of those I'd consider. The other would be an insult.~
@6520 = ~Dragon or not, Flara's a powerful sorceress. An ally like that is worth more than coin.~
@6521 = ~Flara may be...difficult, but that doesn't mean she deserves to be bought and sold like this. I refuse your offer.~
@6522 = ~No deal. I'm on an important mission and I need all the help I can get.~
@6523 = ~If she were just some innocent girl? Absolutely. She's not.~
@6524 = ~Whatever the case, I'm not turning my companions over to a stranger.~
@6525 = ~If need be, but she'd be far more valuable alive.~
@6526 = ~It so happens we've an alchemist friend in Amn who goes through dragon's blood like a dwarf in a distillery. And here we have a renewable supply in a handy human-sized package. Bound to be worth a few bob, no?~
@6527 = ~But she must stop believing she's a dragon first. If she returns to normal, heaven knows what she'll do. Not just to us, but to the town we were protecting, the entire coast...no-one will be safe.~
@6528 = ~But if that was your main concern, you wouldn't bother trying to take her alive. So which is it? Do you want to save the day or do you just want to line your pockets?~
@6529 = ~And you expect my help in this? To trade a person like livestock? No. I refuse.~
@6530 = ~So what's in this for me?~
@6531 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. But I understand. You likely still see her as Flara the charmingly eccentric would-be dragon, not Flara the terrifyingly dangerous actual dragon. Perhaps you need some time to wrap your head around it.~
@6532 = ~*More* time? We don't all have elf blood, you know.~
@6533 = ~We'll be at Baldur's Gate awhile, should you change your mind. Shall we say...Sorcerous Sundries, in the eastern part of town? We'll have a few deposits to make there, I should think.~
@6534 = ~Did you hear what I said?~
@6535 = ~Something delightful, I'm sure.~
@6536 = ~Excellent question! And here's an excellent answer; money. You do this for us and you'll find yourself richer by no less than five hundred gold coins.~
@6537 = ~Now we pay a bounty to earn a bounty? This had better be worth it, Sigurd.~
@6538 = ~My *dear* Krakus. We all have our roles in this party. Yours is to foam at the mouth and eviscerate people. Mine is to handle more delicate exchanges. I assure you, every expense will be accounted for.~
@6539 = ~Forgive him, <CHARNAME>. He was, tragically, born without any restraint. Now then, we shall need time to don our disguises again, so meet us at Baldur's Gate. Perhaps Sorcerous Sundries, in the eastern part of town? We'll have a few deposits to make there, I should think.~
@6540 = ~And remember, she must come of her own will. If we have to take her by force, she'll never believe the story. You have to *convince* her, otherwise our only option will be to kill her.~
@6541 = ~I hope <PRO_HESHE> fails.~
@6542 = ~Come now, Krakus.~
@6543 = ~I hope <PRO_HESHE> fails and I hope you die in the battle.~
@6544 = ~Krakus, be nice.~
@6545 = ~I hope you die slowly, so you have time to ask me for help. And I will say "Patience, Sigurd."~
@6546 = ~I think we'd best get him a drink soon.~
@6547 = ~You heard five hundred. It's not some grand quest, <CHARNAME>. All you're doing is handing her over.~
@6548 = ~One thousand? Big wages for small work, my friend. But let's call it 750, for civility's sake.~
@6549 = ~Far be it from me to offend your esteemed personage! One thousand it is.~
@6550 = ~You might be her ally, but she sure as the hells isn't yours. Whatever promises she made, there are few honest colours of dragon, and red isn't among them.~
@6551 = ~"Silver or gold, their promises hold. Black or red, you'll end up dead." That is my completely improvised poem about which dragons you can trust. No need for applause; the joy of creation is its own reward.~
@6552 = ~You have a deal, then.~
@6553 = ~(Lie) You have a deal, then.~
@6554 = ~Just for that, I'm going to decline.~
@6555 = ~Both. Isn't that what adventuring's all about?~
@6556 = ~<CHARNAME>! What a pleasure to see you again. And, ah...I can't help noticing our beloved Flara is absent?~
@6557 = ~I tried to convince her, but she realised something was amiss. I was forced to kill her.~
@6558 = ~I tried to convince her, but she realised something was amiss and left my company.~
@6559 = ~Only temporarily. I'm still working on it.~
@6560 = ~And she will continue to be so. I will not help with your ruse, Sigurd. That is final.~
@6561 = ~What?!~
@6562 = ~Oh dear.~
@6563 = ~All that time scheming and playing dress-up, only for this <PRO_MANWOMAN> to kill her?! THE VERY THING I SAID WE SHOULD DO FROM THE BEGINNING?!~
@6564 = ~Let's discuss this over some ale, shall we? Lots of ale. A great deal of very strong ale.~
@6565 = ~Oh. Damn.~
@6566 = ~So now we have to go searching for her. Again. Another successful plot from our intrepid leader.~
@6567 = ~And what will we do when we find her?~
@6568 = ~Well, I suppose we could-~
@6569 = ~We will kill her.~
@6570 = ~We will kill her straightforwardly, in combat, with weapons.~
@6571 = ~Yes yes, as you say. I suppose enough is enough.~
@6572 = ~Ah? Playing a longer game, are you? You're after my own heart, my friend. Take your time, then. We can wait.~
@6573 = ~Oh yes. We can wait, can't we? I love waiting. Best part of being an adventurer. Why, I could just spend the rest of my *life* standing here.~
@6574 = ~Charades?~
@6575 = ~NO.~
@6576 = ~Oh gods! Do you realise how refreshing it is to hear someone say that?~
@6577 = ~That's it then? She simply disappears and you refuse to play any further part? I must say, I'm disappointed. It's a poor adventurer that would leave things so unresolved. Just as well we have better ones to set the example, eh?~
@6578 = ~Are you referring to yourself?~
@6579 = ~Naturally.~
@6580 = ~You shouldn't be.~
@6581 = ~No hard feelings, <CHARNAME>. You did your best. Not everyone has my charms, eh?~
@6582 = ~Praise Beshaba for that.~
@6583 = ~Flara!~
@6584 = ~You again? If you have any sense of self-preservation, you'll let us pass without comment. I will brook no more of your lies.~
@6585 = ~Er, yes. Well. That is precisely what I'll do, assuming <CHARNAME> agrees...?~
@6586 = ~Flara, these people aren't your family. Sigurd told me himself.~
@6587 = ~I think you should go with them, Flara.~
@6588 = ~I do. Leave us be.~
@6589 = ~<CHARNAME>! Why would you speak such lies to her?~
@6590 = ~@91 /* Reeves */ there is an illusionist. He's disguised "Lord and Lady Burnheart" to resemble you.~
@6591 = ~You as well?! Has the entire world taken leave of its senses? Am I to become the final bastion of sanity? THEY ARE NOT MY FAMILY. I AM A DRAGON.~
@6592 = ~You're a human. You're a human with human parents, and it's time you made peace with it.~
@6593 = ~Just give them a chance! What do you have to lose?~
@6594 = ~They wouldn't have sought you out like this if they didn't know you! Can you not see how desperate they are?~
@6595 = ~Yes. Yes, of course. But if, by some circumstance, she should change her mind, be sure to bring her back right away, won't you...?~
@6596 = ~I don't know what you're trying to do here, but-~
@6597 = ~They used some kind of ancient wand designed to subdue dragons. Now they want to convince you you're just a human, so you'll stop resisting the magic.~
@6598 = ~Enough. ENOUGH. These people are impostors, do you hear? Madmen or charlatans, I do not know, but if I must count you among them then you are nothing to me but a liability. I will not suffer any of you a moment longer.~
@6599 = ~Wait, wait, wait. You mean to say this man...these people...everything started with them? This curse I bear, this half-baked fiction of a noble family, this ENTIRE farce has been a plot against me?!~
@6600 = ~They wanted me to hand you over to them. Let's just say I'm refusing.~
@6601 = ~I...er...~
@6602 = ~YOU DID THIS! YOU DID THIS TO ME!~
@6603 = ~(Would someone back me up, please?!)~
@6604 = ~Enough! This charade offends my pride more than this stupid hat! Let us settle this as Tempus intended!~
@6605 = ~Hear!~
@6606 = ~Agreed, Sigurd. You always have to overcomplicate things. Let's just let the world be simple for once.~
@6607 = ~You could at least have jumped them. Honestly, people.~
@6608 = ~Flara! Thank goodness we found you again. Perhaps you've reconsidered your decision...?~
@6609 = ~I have.~
@6610 = ~You have? Wonderful! Splendid! We'll take you back to the estate, introduce you to your old friends...you may not remember everything yet, I can see it in your face, but you will.~
@6611 = ~I am sure.~
@6612 = ~Lady Burnheart...mother. When last we met, you tried to embrace me, and I...I spurned you.~
@6613 = ~Hush now. The fault was mine. You were confused and wary, and I should have known better than to try.~
@6614 = ~I was confused, yes. But no longer. It is asking too much, I know, but will you take me in your arms again? I think perhaps it will help.~
@6615 = ~Oh Flara, don't be silly. A hug is never too much to ask from your mother.~
@6616 = ~My little girl...~
@6617 = ~Yes. Good. Now there is but one more thing I need you to do.~
@6618 = ~What is it, dear?~
@6619 = ~Burn.~
@6620 = ~Marina!~
@6621 = ~A quicker death than I would have liked, but all the more time to spend on the rest of you! TREACHEROUS VERMIN!~
@6622 = ~That's it. No more tricks. No more disguises. She dies today. And so does anyone who disagrees.~
@6623 = ~Fine, fine. It's only fair we play it your way once in a while.~
@6624 = ~You'd have done better speaking to her beforehand, <CHARNAME>. Our presence made her far too defensive. Still, no hard feelings. You did your best. Not everyone has my brains, eh?~
@6625 = ~Off we go, friends. Mustn't let her get too far.~
@6626 = ~To a point, yes. This all rings hollow even now, and if that one tries to hug me again, there will be violence.~
@6627 = ~Still. I will afford you the opportunity to substantiate yourselves. See that you do not waste it.~
@6628 = ~Wonderful! Splendid! We'll take you back to the estate, introduce you to your old friends...you may not remember everything yet, but you will.~
@6629 = ~Honestly, these three were beginning to lose hope, but old Sigurd knew you'd come around. Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say everything would work out?~
@6630 = ~We can all see that you were right, Sigurd. Thank you. Now, if we may take our daughter home...~
@6631 = ~Yes, you lot run along and reacquaint yourselves. I'll be with you shortly.~
@6632 = ~Fine work, <CHARNAME>. We'll have a king's ransom for this, but truthfully, the reward I look forward to is vindication. Such friction from my colleagues over a simple bluff! How quickly their faith dwindles! I shall lord this success over them for a good few months, I think.~
@6633 = ~Here is your payment, as agreed, and may your purse always be so heavy. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my companions shall need some acting lessons.~
@6634 = ~Halt, boy. I see you bear the mark of Talos.~
@6635 = ~Er, yes. And so do you, which means I'm probably not being arrested. Do I know you?~
@6636 = ~I am Stormherald Taranis Paladinbane, of the Talassans of Amn, Slayer of Archons and Defiler of Bormton.~
@6637 = ~Oh! I'm Dave.~
@6638 = ~You must be the Athkatlans we were told about. Nice to meet-~
@6639 = ~Save your pleasantries. I have called for a gathering of the faithful, and as such, I order you to return to your...temple. Immediately.~
@6640 = ~*You* called a gathering? I'm sorry, but I'll need to hear it from Stormlord Jeff.~
@6641 = ~"Stormlord" Jeff is dead. By right of conquest, I now command his flock.~
@6642 = ~How do I know you're not ly...oh. That's his head. Well then.~
@6643 = ~It's alright, Dave. We can spare the time.~
@6644 = ~Great. Another trip to the temple. Not like we have anything better to do.~
@6645 = ~Excuse me, but I'm not having you dragging my companions off at your whim.~
@6646 = ~You bastard! I liked him!~
@6647 = ~Your opinion is irrelevant, cur. I am not here for you, and I suggest you mew thanks to Talos that it is so.~
@6648 = ~Quicken your pace, boy. Do not make me come looking.~
@6649 = ~Introductions.~
@6650 = ~You have been told that my name is Taranis, but you will not use it. To you, I am Stormherald. Nothing less.~
@6651 = ~I have been told each of your names, but I will not use them. To me, you are supplicants. Nothing more.~
@6652 = ~How will we know who you're talking to, then?~
@6653 = ~Yes, what happens if, for example, you say "Come here, supplicant"? We all fall in and you shoo us away as applicable?~
@6654 = ~Is it your wish to die, supplicant?~
@6655 = ~...that's a bit of a silly question, isn't it?~
@6656 = ~Then do not interrupt me again.~
@6657 = ~The Sword Coast is a ripe orchard for our kind. From here, south to Calimshan and north to Neverwinter, hundreds of settlements rely on trade across the Sea of Swords to survive. And what do sailors fear more than a storm?~
@6658 = ~Without their ships, the Coast starves. Without Talos' favour, they have no ships. We hold the very heart of the region in our fist.~
@6659 = ~And yet, despite these favourable circumstances, all I see is frivolity. This pathetic excuse for a temple mirrors every one of you. Weak. Wavering. Worthless.~
@6660 = ~It ends now. None of you will return here without a gift. A gift for the glory of Talos. If I deem it unworthy, you will suffer. And if you abandon your task, I will hunt you down and purge our ranks of your disgrace.~
@6661 = ~Now get out.~
@6662 = ~You travel with the Talassan boy, do you not? Bring him to me immediately. My patience wears thin.~
@6663 = ~What is your business here?~
@6664 = ~Was it really necessary to throw everyone out like that?~
@6665 = ~I don't suppose you're offering healing services?~
@6666 = ~That is not your concern.~
@6667 = ~Who are you to question how I run my temple? If my decisions offend you, leave. I am not here to take your complaints.~
@6668 = ~No. There is too much work to be done here. Find your aid elsewhere.~
@6669 = ~So you return. You'd best have done as I asked, or the consequences will be dire.~
@6670 = ~I've brought a gift, yes. Let me ask you something first, though. Why are you here?~
@6671 = ~Do not waste my time, boy. If you have an offering, show me.~
@6672 = ~No, come on. Humour me for just a moment. One Talassan to another. What's in it for you to leave Athkatla for a dump like this?  You clearly don't like our temple, or any of us.~
@6673 = ~What I like or don't like has nothing to do with it. Suffice to say, our temple seeks a new Weathermaster, and this is but one of the errands I must endure to reach the position.~
@6674 = ~So this is all just a stepping stone to you? You don't take any joy in it whatsoever?~
@6675 = ~Do I take *joy* in it? In whipping some ferocity into this whimpering pack of dogs? No. I do not.~
@6676 = ~Perfect.~
@6677 = ~I challenge you to a Trial by Thunder.~
@6678 = ~...um.~
@6679 = ~You can't...you can't just say no. Can you? Are you allowed to do that? Don't you want to teach me my place or...something?~
@6680 = ~If you do not know your place already, know that any pissant village runt could take it from you. You are not worth the effort.~
@6681 = ~What was your goal in this? To become Stormherald? The rigours of my rank would eat you, boy. To even call you supplicant does you more credit than you deserve.~
@6682 = ~I'm not after your title. In fact, losing wouldn't cost you anything at all. All I want is for you to go back to Amn.~
@6683 = ~And suppose I did accept your terms. What would be my prize when I defeated you? That lump of stone you're carrying?~
@6684 = ~This is an idol of Kozah, Taranis. Maybe you don't-~
@6685 = ~*Stormherald*.~
@6686 = ~Maybe you don't know the name Kozah, *Taranis*, but I do, and so does everyone else in this temple. This idol filled a room with the winds of Pandemonium. The workers who excavated it all killed each other in a frenzy when they heard it howling. It has power, and if you're really a Talassan then you can feel it as much as I do.~
@6687 = ~You want an offering for Talos? Here it is. Right in my hands. All you have to do is win it.~
@6688 = ~Outside.~
@6689 = ~I have hunted the spineless dregs of the Radiant Heart and slain them with your hallowed lightning. I have put hamlets and villages to the storm in your name. And always I have strived to elevate myself in your greatest of churches...~
@6690 = ~Still wearing those boots, eh?~
@6691 = ~Comfiest pair I've ever had.~
@6692 = ~Jammy bastard. They were just my size, too...~
@6693 = ~Maybe we'll go shopping later. Ask around, find someone with a nice pair of sheepskins, then raze his town to rubble.~
@6694 = ~You still got those boots?~
@6695 = ~Yes. Somewhere.~
@6696 = ~So you're not using 'em.~
@6697 = ~Well. Usual procedure for contests would say that if the winner rejects their prize, as you might say you've done, in a way, manner of speaking, said prize should go to second place. Yeah?~
@6698 = ~You're very kind, but I'm not sure they'd fit me.~
@6699 = ~Nah, I sold those off a while ago. ~
@6700 = ~What?! Oh, brilliant. And not a thought spared for poor old Phil and his bunions, I suppose.~
@6701 = ~There was, actually. I thought "I can't wait to tell poor old Phil and his bunions that I sold that comfy pair of fur-lined boots."~
@6702 = ~Argh!~
@6703 = ~I...I have lived by your words since childhood. No other god may challenge your power. No other...~
@6704 = ~Does anyone remember Thornacre?~
@6705 = ~'Course I do.~
@6706 = ~Good, because nobody else will in a few dozen years.~
@6707 = ~Pfft!~
@6708 = ~My family...! Your priests tore me from my mother and sister, but I cared not! To be raised as your servant was a blessing! They mean NOTHING to me! There is only you, great Talos! None come before you!~
@6709 = ~You know who doesn't remember, though? Phil. He was drunk out of his gourd that day.~
@6710 = ~No no. Thornacre. Rings a bell. That was the typhoon, wasn't it? And the flaming whisky wagons?~
@6711 = ~Yeah. You was in one of 'em.~
@6712 = ~You what?~
@6713 = ~You passed out, so me and Brian dumped you in the back and crashed it into the town hall.~
@6714 = ~Ah, ya rotten bastards! So that's why I woke up in that state! Coming home with my clothes all scorched...do you know how much guff I took from the wife over that?~
@6715 = ~YES! WE ONLY HEARD ABOUT IT FOR THREE MONTHS!~
@6716 = ~Heh heh! I thought she was gonna pop! By Talos, I love this bloody job!~
@6717 = ~I know, Phil. So do I.~
@6718 = ~How...? Why, Talos? Have I strayed from your path? Are my works not enough in your eyes? How could you find me unworthy...?~
@6719 = ~You're not unworthy, Taranis.~
@6720 = ~You...~
@6721 = ~You're a fine servant. I'm sure you could spend days boasting about all the havoc you've wreaked in Talos' name. But you're missing something.~
@6722 = ~You don't enjoy it. That seems like such a small thing, I know, but it's not. Who do you think make the greatest craftsmen? The people who work for power and prestige? Who treat it all as just means to an end? No. It's the people who love every minute of what they do, and can teach others to love it as well.~
@6723 = ~Thunder is Talos' laughter. If you're not laughing with him, what's the point?~
@6724 = ~What is this DRIVEL? Must you compound the insult?! Take my head and be done!~
@6725 = ~No. When Talos' faithful start killing each other, all it does is weaken us. There's still hope for you.~
@6726 = ~Remember what I asked you to do. Return to your temple. Tell them you weren't needed here after all. And then...just think about what you're really doing here. Think if you want to spend your life clawing up the ranks of a church that means nothing to you, just so you can lead people you don't care about. I certainly wouldn't.~
@6727 = ~Go on, then. It's a long walk to Amn.~
@6728 = ~*reach down to pet it*~
@6729 = ~Meow to you too.~
@6730 = ~Kitty!~
@6731 = ~I wouldn't do that. She'll have your fingers off.~
@6732 = ~That's Stormlord Jeff's familiar. He studied as a battlemage for years before he found Talos.~
@6733 = ~She can't speak. She got trampled by a hippogriff on the field, never quite recovered. But she does understand what you're saying, so...be civil. ~
@6734 = ~Gods. As if one allegedly articulate furball wasn't enough.~
@6735 = ~Well met, my feline friend.~
@6736 = ~You really understand me? Prove it.~
@6737 = ~Who's a fluffy kitty? You are! Yes you are!~
@6738 = ~Boo says there is nothing articulate about his allegedness! No, wait...~
@6739 = ~(Thundercat rolls her eyes.)~
@6740 = ~(Thundercat sticks out her tongue at you.)~
@6741 = ~(Thundercat stares at you contemptuously.)~
@6742 = ~What did I just say?!~
@6743 = ~*hiss*~
@6744 = ~Psst. Hey. Need any work done?~
@6745 = ~Who are you?~
@6746 = ~Are you a...?~
@6747 = ~Get away from me!~
@6748 = ~Name's Vynd. Work?~
@6749 = ~What sort of "work" are we talking about?~
@6750 = ~Yeah yeah, I'm a dark elf. Call the Fist. Show them all these dead bodies surrounding me. Do you have any work or not?~
@6751 = ~What's a drow doing on the surface?~
@6752 = ~Hey, you came to me. You get away. You're stinking up my corner.~
@6753 = ~Not to encourage any stereotypes, but I'm an armed drow lurking in the corner of a tavern. Use your imagination.~
@6754 = ~I could use another travelling companion, actually.~
@6755 = ~Don't have anything. Sorry.~
@6756 = ~Looking for work. Got any?~
@6757 = ~What, just someone to keep you company? That doesn't sound like it pays much.~
@6758 = ~Wait. You're not an adventurer, are you?~
@6759 = ~Is that a problem?~
@6760 = ~What gave it away?~
@6761 = ~Not officially. I just stumble across monsters and old ruins a lot.~
@6762 = ~Anything comes up, let me know. I'll be here.~
@6763 = ~Alright, I guess I've got nothing else going. Equal share of the loot, fifty gold down payment, and I'm not obliged to raise you if you die. Deal?~
@6764 = ~Deal.~
@6765 = ~Twenty-five.~
@6766 = ~No deal.~
@6767 = ~You would have us pay for you? I *demand* your service, male, and you'll thank me for the opportunity.~
@6768 = ~Hey, "mistress." I know you've been raised to think you can butt in on whatever you want, but the surface has some hard lessons for you. Consider this your first; shut your mouth.~
@6769 = ~You will not ever use that tone with me! I'm not so loath to make a scene that I wouldn't discipline you in this very tavern!~
@6770 = ~Yes, mistress.~
@6771 = ~And by that, I mean yes, I will use that tone with you, and if you don't like it, I as your humble subservient male will gladly spare you the effort of SHOVING IT UP YOUR ARSE.~
@6772 = ~Uh...so fifty gold, you said?~
@6773 = ~Forget it. Somehow I don't think you two will work well together.~
@6774 = ~Right. And if it means travelling with her, that's non-negotiable. Take it or leave it.~
@6775 = ~Suit yourself. Maybe you'll survive without me. Maybe you won't.~
@6776 = ~Uh...figure of speech. I'm not actually going anywhere.~
@6777 = ~Alright, forty gold.~
@6778 = ~Lead on, then. I've got everything I'll need. Except my better judgment. That seems to have gone missing.~
@6779 = ~Do you mind? There's plenty of space away from the big, scary drow.~
@6780 = ~Changed your mind? Before you answer, I should mention I saw a merchant caravan massacred by bandits not that long ago. Terrible thing. If only I'd been with them, they might still be alive.~
@6781 = ~Alright, you win. Forty gold.~
@6782 = ~Changed your mind? Before you answer, I should mention I saw a merchant caravan massacred by bandits on the way into town. Terrible thing. If only I'd been with them...~
@6783 = ~Alright, you win. Fifty gold.~
@6784 = ~Fifty gold's too much. Make it twenty-five.~
@6785 = ~Changed your mind? Fifty gold, like I said. Believe me, that's a bargain for what I'll be putting up with.~
@6786 = ~Not a big enough bargain for me.~
@6787 = ~Back again. With a job, I hope.~
@6788 = ~I'd like you to travel with me.~
@6789 = ~No, nothing yet.~
@6790 = ~Forty or I walk.~
@6791 = ~Forty it is.~
@6792 = ~Walk, then.~
@6793 = ~Oh, the poor thing had to work in the dark for a few months. And lo, Vynd's tears did flood the Cloakwood.~
@6794 = ~Would that they had.~
@6795 = ~Uh. Where did you come from?~
@6796 = ~Where did SHE come from? Do people just barge into this house whenever they feel like it?~
@6797 = ~That's what we did.~
@6798 = ~That's what we do with every house, actually.~
@6799 = ~I have a question first. Did Duke Silvershield like to dismiss all his guards, strip naked and walk backwards into dark alleys with his eyes closed?~
@6800 = ~'Cause if not, I have no idea how you two took him down.~
@6801 = ~Hey Krystin. Bet you this chump can't mouth off through a gulletful of steel.~
@6802 = ~<CHARNAME>, let me tell you something right now.~
@6803 = ~I don't know if you're planning to kill Sarevok or not. Your problem, your choice. But if you are, please don't walk up and introduce yourself first. Please don't do that. I'm glad our enemies do it, but if someone on my side did it, it would hurt me in ways you can't imagine.~
@6804 = ~Just. Kill. Him.~
@6805 = ~Yes, idiot, we're all tired of living. Bring it on. What kind of arse-backwards banditry is this?~
@6806 = ~Yeah. Regarding that halfling. Who wants to tell her that a couple of ogrillons spread him across the road like jam on toast?~
@6807 = ~Oh. I guess I do.~
@6808 = ~Do you get off on being an arsehole, or what?~
@6809 = ~Sometimes honesty is the best policy. Brutal, unrelenting honesty.~
@6810 = ~Er...thank you again. You should leave now, please.~
@6811 = ~So will I.~
@6812 = ~Wait just a damn minute. If giving the hair to someone traps them here, then taking the hair from you would trap US here.~
@6813 = ~Oh, I assure you, it...it doesn't work like that.~
@6814 = ~Oh. Doesn't it. That's alright, then.~
@6815 = ~<CHARNAME>, if we do get trapped here, I'm eating you. I'm not even going to wait till I'm starving. I will kill and eat you.~
@6816 = ~Please do. I desperately need some entertainment.~
@6817 = ~Wait, so all your other victims got that riddle wrong? Hell, you're innocent. They deserved it.~
@6818 = ~Oh, this is gonna be good.~
@6819 = ~Eight thousand?! I would literally rather die. Resurrection's cheaper.~
@6820 = ~By "disturbed" you mean "looked at."~
@6821 = ~Close enough!~
@6822 = ~Why did we just fight an army of exploding choristers?~
@6823 = ~They attacked us. It was self-defence.~
@6824 = ~Let's not dwell on it.~
@6825 = ~I'm not asking about our motives. I want to know why that happened to us.~
@6826 = ~These things should not happen.~
@6827 = ~Fastest dart thrower on the coast?~
@6828 = ~Damn right. Now-~
@6829 = ~Second fastest.~
@6830 = ~You're in for it now, pal!~
@6831 = ~Push him, <CHARNAME>. It's what he wants, it's what I want, and we both know it's what you want.~
@6832 = ~2000? We could buy him a new son for half that. One that isn't stupid.~
@6833 = ~Drow learn an incredibly complex language of gestures and facial expressions to conceal what they're saying. Humans put Common through a mangle. Maybe I *should* be racist.~
@6834 = ~"So I'm just going to murder you all in public, as the law dictates."~
@6835 = ~Hmm. That is true. To execute you without proof is not justice. You may go for now.~
@6836 = ~Really?~
@6837 = ~Alright, is the guy you're disguised as supposed to be creepy as hell? Because if not, you should try not being creepy as hell.~
@6838 = ~Don't feel bad. This is how people should react.~
@6839 = ~Bye.~
@6840 = ~We could do that. Or we could just start snapping his fingers. I'd say he'll squeal at...two.~
@6841 = ~Wait. How long have you been out here?~
@6842 = ~Oh, I'm not sure. A while.~
@6843 = ~You didn't think to ask *inside* the tavern?~
@6844 = ~Why...no, I never did. Still, I suppose it worked out. You're here now, are you not?~
@6845 = ~Worked out? I just got paid peanuts to be an "adventurer", and all this time I could have had a one-off job for three hundred. No. It did not work out. You little bastard.~
@6846 = ~Okay, I know we're gonna pummel this guy regardless? But he's right.~
@6847 = ~Ba ha haa. You ass.~
@6848 = ~This sounds familiar. Edwin.~
@6849 = ~"Skeleton skull." I love mages.~
@6850 = ~Hmm. My farm is openly infested with giant acid-spitting beetles. Now what could've happened to my son?~
@6851 = ~Fifty gold says she can't tell the difference between bandit scalps and any other scalp.~
@6852 = ~What's that supposed to mean?~
@6853 = ~Well Plunkett, obviously I'm suggesting we butcher and desecrate helpless civilians. Because I'm sure you'd be very receptive to that.~
@6854 = ~I'm just saying, we fight a lot of people who aren't technically bandits. If we happened to lop their tops off afterwards...~
@6855 = ~Then we'd be swindlers.~
@6856 = ~Gods. No pleasing you, is there?~
@6857 = ~Twenty-five for a healing potion? And I'm supposed to believe you didn't just piss in a flask?~
@6858 = ~BORDA~ ~Too good to be true, is it? Perhaps you've been buying from the wrong vendors?~
@6859 = ~I know what a damn potion's worth. Believe me. I know.~
@6860 = ~BORDA~ ~Very well. Fifty for the potion.~
@6861 = ~*What?* That's not what I was...~
@6862 = ~BORDA~ ~Your friend clearly knows a bargain when <PRO_HESHE> sees it.~
@6863 = ~You know what, <CHARNAME>? Drink it. Drink it all. You deserve it.~
@6864 = ~BORDA~ ~Indeed. Ta-ta, now.~
@6865 = ~Notice his lovable speech impediment vanished when you agreed to help. Sneaky little git.~
@6866 = ~Incidentally...~
@6867 = ~(Damn it.)~
@6868 = ~Am I mistaken, or have I a kinsman before me?~
@6869 = ~No. This is not grounds for a conversation. Humans don't say "Oh look, another human. I'd better introduce myself." Why are we doing it?~
@6870 = ~I'm sure they would where their kind are scarce. A sunlit drow is a rare enough sight.~
@6871 = ~Well it shouldn't be. So let's you and I pretend it isn't, and maybe it'll come true.~
@6872 = ~As you wish. Whatever the reason, it is good you escaped. Treat the surface folk with respect; you'll see reciprocation in time. Farewell.~
@6873 = ~Don't say anything. I want to see if he notices.~
@6874 = ~Hear that, Eldoth? Slimes! Finally you can make some friends!~
@6875 = ~My pets...if they try to run, kill them.~
@6876 = ~We want to know why you're so fat?~
@6877 = ~How have you come to dwell here, in this dreary abode?~
@6878 = ~What's your name?~
@6879 = ~Could you tell us about the Iron Throne?~
@6880 = ~Not as fat as Lolth. Bam! Hope you heard that, hag.~
@6881 = ~What more do you wisssh to know?~
@6882 = ~So why are you so fat? Not to pry or anything...~
@6883 = ~Do you know anything about the Iron Throne?~
@6884 = ~How is it that you came to live in this place?~
@6885 = ~Hey everyone! Apparently this man's a hit with the horses! Real filly-killer! Lock up your mares!~
@6886 = ~You wouldn't know wit if it sliced your bulging gut open and sprayed gallons of Baldur's Gate's cheapest booze over the horrified patrons of the Three Old Kegs.~
@6887 = ~Or would you?~
@6888 = ~Heh. From parrying magecock day and night to being boiled down for spell juice. Never know what you got till it's gone, huh?~
@6889 = ~Out, please, out. I must work in silence.~
@6890 = ~Ten thousand, huh?~
@6891 = ~Ah, you'd want to split it, though. Forget it.~
@6892 = ~Oh my gods. This is hilarious. I love you.~
@6893 = ~Enough!~
@6894 = ~No, let's see if we can find another mage. We'll tour the world!~
@6895 = ~A hundred gold? We'll get right on that. Unrelated question; can you swim?~
@6896 = ~N...no, why?~
@6897 = ~What does he need a bribe for? We already killed...alright, fine. I suppose we just throw money at people now. Here, have some of mine.~
@6898 = ~Ow! Er, thank you.~
@6899 = ~No problem. Want another one?~
@6900 = ~Ow. Sir, please...~
@6901 = ~Buy some soap.~
@6902 = ~Vynd!~
@6903 = ~What? Just following your example.~
@6904 = ~Um, thank you again, friends. If you'll excuse me...~
@6905 = ~One for the road.~
@6906 = ~OW!~
@6907 = ~Huh. Swear that carcass looks familiar.~
@6908 = ~Yep! I'd recognise that underbite anywhere. How've you been, Abdel? Surprised you even made it this far. Is it too late to say I told you so?~
@6909 = ~Yep! I'd recognise that underbite anywhere. How've you been, Canderous? Surprised you even made it this far. Is it too late to say I told you so?~
@6910 = ~"Not at all, Vynd! You were the only one with any sense and I definitely should've listened to you!"~
@6911 = ~That's right, Abdel. You should have.~
@6912 = ~That's right, Canderous. You should have.~
@6913 = ~Whenever you're ready, Vynd.~
@6914 = ~Sorry. Had to get that out of my system.~
@6915 = ~I was, in fact, kidding.~
@6916 = ~I'm not apologising.~
@6917 = ~Agh!~
@6918 = ~NO!~
@6919 = ~What the hell, Plunkett?! Gods!~
@6920 = ~Called it.~
@6921 = ~Oh, yay for you. Cat dived off a sodding waterfall and it's dead. Who'd've thought.~
@6922 = ~No victory is too petty, Plunkett.~
@6923 = ~Aaand you shot me for nothing.~
@6924 = ~You probably done something to deserve it. Just not that.~
@6925 = ~DRIENN~ ~You folks are weird...~
@6926 = ~I hereby request we never let Flara talk to anyone again.~
@6927 = ~Nonsense. Their tongues are still and their treasure is ours. There could be no better outcome.~
@6928 = ~Looks like a nice selection here. Anyone want anything?~
@6929 = ~Vynd wants to buy a round? Potions out, mates. He's finally decided to poison us.~
@6930 = ~I could do with some water.~
@6931 = ~The round rule separates us from the animals, Plunkett. It's sacrosanct. Even to me.~
@6932 = ~Get us a brandy, then.~
@6933 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@6934 = ~I'll have what she's having.~
@6935 = ~Beer for me, thanks.~
@6936 = ~A nice dry wine would be just the thing.~
@6937 = ~Their finest mead, if you would.~
@6938 = ~I need something stiff. Get me a whisky.~
@6939 = ~Something exotic. Surprise me.~
@6940 = ~How about some Spiderblood?~
@6941 = ~We really don't have time for this.~
@6942 = ~Har de har, <CHARNAME>. Seriously, what do you want? The window's closing.~
@6943 = ~Actually, it happens I do have a bottle of-~
@6944 = ~I'll have what Littlun's having.~
@6945 = ~Suit yourself, but if we're skipping my turn, yours is up next.~
@6946 = ~Right. Moidre?~
@6947 = ~Can I just get some water?~
@6948 = ~Wait your turn. Moidre. Ale?~
@6949 = ~How did I guess. And, ah, water. Right.~
@6950 = ~Aren't you going to ask me?~
@6951 = ~I heard you the first time!~
@6952 = ~I know, but I'm not sure now. Do they have a menu?~
@6953 = ~Shut up. Flara?~
@6954 = ~Molten platinum.~
@6955 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, two Cherryfire brandies, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6956 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, one Golden Sands beer, one Cherryfire brandy, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6957 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, one Saerloonian Topaz, one Cherryfire brandy, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6958 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, one Evermead, one Cherryfire brandy, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6959 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, one Moonshae Moonshine, one Cherryfire brandy, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6960 = ~Alright, whatever. Barkeep, one mug of your soupiest, most toxic ale, one Berduskan Dark, one Jhulid, one Cherryfire brandy, and a cup of MOLTEN PLATINUM.~
@6961 = ~Er. We don't have that.~
@6962 = ~Guess what, Flara. They don't have it.~
@6963 = ~Oi, ain't you a-~
@6964 = ~Dark. Elf. So what? You want to call the guard? Have them execute a complete stranger on suspicion of suspiciousness? Or do you want to take this gold here, plus a little bit extra because I'm feeling spendy today, and give me some goddamned drinks?~
@6965 = ~...what was it you wanted again?~
@6966 = ~One red wine, one...uh...~
@6967 = ~*sigh* Need a recap of those orders, folks. Someone punch Dave in the mouth for me.~
@6968 = ~I dunno. I'm feeling a little...~
@6969 = ~YAAARGH! BLOOD WILL QUIET! BLOOD WILL QUIET!~
@6970 = ~Holy Lolth. We just killed Drizzt Do'Urden. I...I have no idea how I feel about that.~
@6971 = ~This isn't the start of a trend, I hope. We're not all, uh, whatever you thought he was.~
@6972 = ~Mouthy smartarses?~
@6973 = ~Self-righteous windbags?~
@6974 = ~Worthy challenges?~
@6975 = ~Loaded with expensive magical items?~
@6976 = ~Okay. Excuse me while I widen our berth a few miles.~
@6977 = ~Oh. Yeah, we're definitely not all that. Carry on, then.~
@6978 = ~Oh. Of course, I understand. I certainly can't enjoy myself without a big enough risk of getting slaughtered.~
@6979 = ~Something wrong with you, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Badly wrong.~
@6980 = ~Ohh. I'm with you now. Had me thinking it was a racial thing.~
@6981 = ~I call Icingdeath.~
@6982 = ~Heh, Icingdeath. Like death by icing. Ate too much cake or something. Stupid name. Sorry, I'm rambling. Adrenaline, you know. God damn.~
@6983 = ~Wow. Masters of infiltration, these doppelgangers.~
@6984 = ~You okay over there?~
@6985 = ~I'm fine.~
@6986 = ~I could be better!~
@6987 = ~They're here. They're here. Oh gods. They're in my home.~
@6988 = ~Never mind me. Stay on your guard.~
@6989 = ~Yeah, if they're all as talented as our friend here, you'll have no trouble telling who's who.~
@6990 = ~Relax. If they're all as talented as our friend here, you'll have no trouble telling who's who.~
@6991 = ~Unless they've been doppelgangers THE WHOLE TIME.~
@6992 = ~Don't even joke.~
@6993 = ~Oh gods, no! NOOOOOOO!~
@6994 = ~I'm just rattling your cage. Really, what are the chances that your entire life has been a lie? I'd say it's only very *slightly* plausible.~
@6995 = ~Yeah. Joking. That's what I was doing.~
@6996 = ~*slap*~
@6997 = ~Just so you know, I'm not what you on the surface would call a good person. Play hero if you like, but don't expect me to join in.~
@6998 = ~That's very...forthright of you.~
@6999 = ~Why leave the Underdark, then?~
@7000 = ~I get tired of people assuming I'm some tormented redemption-seeker. "Oh, he's on the surface! He must be one of the nice ones! Pity the poor soul!" Gimme a break.~
@7001 = ~You start thinking that of me, then eventually I'll do something you don't like, and "Oops, looks like I didn't hire an angel after all. Kill all drow." I'd rather settle it now.~
@7002 = ~Sounds like you'd be right at home in the Underdark, then. Why did you leave?~
@7003 = ~I'd have expected everyone to assume the worst.~
@7004 = ~If that's the case, you're not welcome here.~
@7005 = ~Makes no difference to me. Stay if you want to.~
@7006 = ~As long as you don't cross me, there won't be an issue.~
@7007 = ~Why leave? Because in the Underdark, there are mind flayers, beholders and aboleths. Up here, there are sheep. And trees. So I weighed things up and I thought, you know what? How bad could a little sunburn possibly be?~
@7008 = ~Pretty bad, as it turns out. But still not as bad as having your brain eaten.~
@7009 = ~Also, nobody up here will torture you to death for not licking Lolth's arse with every flick of your tongue. So there's that.~
@7010 = ~What was the point of telling me this?~
@7011 = ~Well now that you've admitted it, I can't keep you in the party.~
@7012 = ~You'd think. Kinda been half and half ever since Drizzt started making waves. I prefer the torches and pitchforks, honestly. At least they don't make me sick.~
@7013 = ~So let's clear it up. Do I stay or not?~
@7014 = ~No. I can't stand by you now that I know this.~
@7015 = ~It doesn't bother me. Stay if you want.~
@7016 = ~What makes you think I consider myself a good person?~
@7017 = ~I'll be off, then. You don't mind if I keep this stuff, do you? Don't answer that.~
@7018 = ~Now is that the truth, or are you just saying it? Eager to find out.~
@7019 = ~Maybe I overstated myself. I'm a selfish bastard, yes. I also don't turn on my colleagues, because I'm not stupid. So let's say I'm half-drow.~
@7020 = ~Is that a trick question? Or are the standards up here even higher than I thought?~
@7021 = ~Either way, I suppose that's a yes. Fair enough.~
@7022 = ~Nothing in particular, but then I don't know you. Doesn't hurt to check.~
@7023 = ~You'd be amazed at the things people can do and still call themselves good.~
@7024 = ~Ugh. Sun's out with a vengeance today. I think Lathander just scored.~
@7025 = ~Does daylight still bother you?~
@7026 = ~That's a colourful image.~
@7027 = ~Deal with it.~
@7028 = ~No, I just whine about it to pass the time.~
@7029 = ~You think gods are above that kind of thing? If only. Any stirrings in the pantheon, chances are someone stuck something somewhere they shouldn't have.~
@7030 = ~Complaining is how I deal with it. You deal with it.~
@7031 = ~It's not as bad as it was, at least. Used to feel like it was flaying my skin off, and yes, I am speaking from experience. Now I just get hot. Really hot. And this snug leather doesn't do me any favours.~
@7032 = ~We can stick to travelling at night, if it's a problem.~
@7033 = ~You'll just have to deal with it.~
@7034 = ~It's doing me a few favours.~
@7035 = ~Ah, don't baby me. I've had worse than sweaty chafing.~
@7036 = ~Besides, when I peel off a damp shirt at the end of the day, it reminds me I'm a free man.~
@7037 = ~Yyyyeah. You can go ahead and pack that in. Not with you, not up here, not in a million lifetimes.~
@7038 = ~I wouldn't mind some sweaty chafing myself.~
@7039 = ~Onward, then.~
@7040 = ~With the heat, or with your come hithering? 'Cause I'll tell you, the heat's less uncomfortable.~
@7041 = ~Alright, enough. Seriously.~
@7042 = ~I wouldn't mind peeling-~
@7043 = ~Oh look, I dropped a hint! Maybe you could pick it up for me!~
@7044 = ~Heard your dad died.~
@7045 = ~And here I thought you were discreet.~
@7046 = ~My foster father, yes. I still can't believe he's gone.~
@7047 = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@7048 = ~So will you if you bring this up again.~
@7049 = ~I dunno. Just making conversation.~
@7050 = ~Only when I'm working.~
@7051 = ~*Foster* father? Lucky you. You get orphaned in the Underdark, that's too damn bad, son. Better find a taste for lichen.~
@7052 = ~Mine died too, funnily enough. Before I was born. Pretty sure my mother did it.~
@7053 = ~The difference is, I care.~
@7054 = ~Is that normal for the drow?~
@7055 = ~Any advice? I'm not sure how to cope.~
@7056 = ~Ooh, look at you with your big blubbery surface emotions. Let me get you a hanky.~
@7057 = ~For your information, I do care. Maybe I'm not broken up about it, but I'd like to have met him.~
@7058 = ~Do drow women often kill their husbands?~
@7059 = ~It's common enough, especially with prestigious mothers. See, the child might be female, and if it is, you don't want them knowing their father. That's a male influence. That'll poison them because males are all completely useless at everything, obviously.~
@7060 = ~Also, spiders eat their mates after doing the business, and boy do we ever love our spiders. Surprised we aren't being born with spinnerets by now.~
@7061 = ~Was your mother prestigious?~
@7062 = ~Uh...get raised in a society that gouges out any sense of affection you might have developed. That worked for me.~
@7063 = ~"Husbands" is about the most naive word you could have used, but...~
@7064 = ~She was.~
@7065 = ~But not anymore.~
@7066 = ~Looks like you're doing alright for yourself anyway. Could have been worse.~
@7067 = ~I suppose you're right.~
@7068 = ~That's all you have to say about it?~
@7069 = ~Thank you for the sympathy. I'll put it in the ice bucket.~
@7070 = ~'Course I am. Get used to it, it happens a lot.~
@7071 = ~What, should I say I'm sorry for your loss? What would that mean coming from me? I didn't know him and I barely know you.~
@7072 = ~It's called being civil, Vynd.~
@7073 = ~Whatever you say.~
@7074 = ~It's called pretending. The day I saw the sun, I was done pretending.~
@7075 = ~I wonder if this place has spiderblood. 'Cause if it does, I'm burning it down.~
@7076 = ~Spiderblood?~
@7077 = ~Somehow I doubt it.~
@7078 = ~*Goodnight*, Vynd.~
@7079 = ~Drow booze, made with venom. Perfect if you like to skip the happy bit and go straight to the hangover.~
@7080 = ~Yeah, tough sell up here. Can I get you an ale, sir, or would you like some toxic arachnid secretions?~
@7081 = ~I don't suppose you know who came up with it?~
@7082 = ~I've drank worse.~
@7083 = ~Goodnight, Vynd.~
@7084 = ~Before you can even enjoy it...by "enjoy it", I mean "not die"...you have to build up a tolerance. Take a sip every few hours, every day, for three months, by which time you're sick of it anyway. Only a drow could have come up with that.~
@7085 = ~Whose bright idea was that?~
@7086 = ~I wouldn't think they stock it, no.~
@7087 = ~Nobody's credited with the invention, which means it was a man. Beyond that, no.~
@7088 = ~Worse-tasting? Maybe. Worse after-effects? I doubt it.~
@7089 = ~If you need me, I'll be down here flushing out my faculties.~
@7090 = ~Someone who had a day they wanted to forget at any cost. So it could have been anyone.~
@7091 = ~There's not much to work with, that deep underground. It's spiders or mushrooms, and damn it, you need to get drunk somehow. ~
@7092 = ~What's mushroom beer like?~
@7093 = ~We'd rather drink poison. I think that says it all.~
@7094 = ~Here's to grapes.~
@7095 = ~Have you ever felt like the world's too big? Like you're never quite where you're supposed to be?~
@7096 = ~I'm "supposed" to be in Candlekeep, so yes.~
@7097 = ~No. I'm meant to be wherever I am.~
@7098 = ~Shuuut uuuup.~
@7099 = ~Ah, but that means you know where to be. You're just not there. That's not what I'm talking about.~
@7100 = ~Are you, though? You could sail to another country right now and not be leaving anything behind. Maybe that's where your fortune is. How would you know?~
@7101 = ~It's like...imagine being fed nothing but boiled potatoes your whole life. Then one day you get invited to a banquet. All different kinds of food. More than you could ever eat.~
@7102 = ~So you try one dish, and it's pretty good. But is it the best one? Should you keep eating it or try something else? Hey, the fish looks nice...oh, wait, somebody else took it. Maybe I should go to the other end of the table, but what if I don't like anything there? Will that one dish be there when I get back? Oh gods, now they're clearing the plates away. I wasn't done yet.~
@7103 = ~But even then, even when you're reduced to a confused, paralysed wreck and all the food disappears around you, one thing's for sure. You're not going near those potatoes.~
@7104 = ~Confused and paralysed? You?~
@7105 = ~Vynd, if you're hungry, just say so.~
@7106 = ~You must grow some damn good potatoes, then.~
@7107 = ~Nobody's above it, <CHARNAME>. Too much choice and not enough direction. It'll paralyse anyone. ~
@7108 = ~I'm hungry AND I have a point to make. One step at a time.~
@7109 = ~Do you know about driders? Seems like the kind of horror story that might crawl its way up.~
@7110 = ~I've heard of them, yes.~
@7111 = ~I can't say I do.~
@7112 = ~First time I saw one, I thought a drow took a spider to bed. Still not convinced that doesn't actually happen.~
@7113 = ~Turns out it's a curse. Something Lolth does to priestesses who fail her. I dunno the details. Us males don't get told these things.~
@7114 = ~But I said, hold on a minute. If spiders are so great, and violence is so great, how come being turned into a half-spider killing machine is a bad thing?~
@7115 = ~And I get flogged for a week. Drow culture, everybody.~
@7116 = ~That's horrible.~
@7117 = ~That's ridiculous.~
@7118 = ~Did they at least give you an answer?~
@7119 = ~Teach you not to ask stupid questions, then.~
@7120 = ~Waist-down, spider. Waist-up, drow. Just as smart, twice as dangerous.~
@7121 = ~That's potatoes.~
@7122 = ~Guess.~
@7123 = ~Even if it was a stupid question, which it wasn't, you have to ask stupid questions before you can start asking smart ones.~
@7124 = ~It's called learning. Drow don't seem to care for it.~
@7125 = ~So is this how you wanted your life to go?~
@7126 = ~Not in the least.~
@7127 = ~What, my father getting murdered and bounties on my head? Not really.~
@7128 = ~With a drow yammering in my ear non-stop? No. Shut up.~
@7129 = ~Then you're only here because you feel like you have to be. Not good, my friend.~
@7130 = ~Here's a little nugget of wisdom. Anyone who says "I have to do this" is lying. There's always a way out. And I'm a drow walking on the surface, so don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. If you don't want to adventure, don't adventure. Find a way.~
@7131 = ~I didn't ask for your opinion.~
@7132 = ~It's not that simple. ~
@7133 = ~The way you talked when we met, it sounds like you've done some adventuring yourself.~
@7134 = ~Enough talk. Stay focused.~
@7135 = ~I mean apart from that. If none of this had happened, would you still want to be "adventuring" or whatever? Stay home? Run a tavern?~
@7136 = ~I'd much rather live in peace.~
@7137 = ~I think I was born to do this.~
@7138 = ~Now there's a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who knows <PRO_HIMHER>self. That's a good sign.~
@7139 = ~Mind you, not such a good sign that you'd actually want to make a living this way.~
@7140 = ~People rarely do. I've learned to be proactive.~
@7141 = ~It is. I don't care what you're facing, I don't care what obligations you think you have. The only person that can hold you to anything is you. Learn that, and live.~
@7142 = ~That's enough. Stay focused.~
@7143 = ~If you can call it that. Got roped in by some greenhorn and his case of tools for a while. I dunno, I think I'd been drinking.~
@7144 = ~Of course, they thought they were teaming up with Drizzt, all whirlwind swords and heroic standoffs. I kept saying I wasn't like that, they thought I was being modest. Hiding my real skill for a dramatic moment.~
@7145 = ~So we cull a few critters, get some pocket money from the local authorities, you know. Then one morning, "Hey guys, I heard about this place called Durlag's Tower."~
@7146 = ~How did that turn out?~
@7147 = ~I think I can figure out the rest. Let's move on.~
@7148 = ~Yeah, you may have noticed I was alone when you hired me.~
@7149 = ~You just abandoned them?~
@7150 = ~Sounds like you did the smart thing.~
@7151 = ~No idea. I took one look and left them to it.~
@7152 = ~I explained the situation very clearly. "If we go in there, we are all going to die, except me, because I will be gone." Whatever they did after that, it's on their heads.~
@7153 = ~They wouldn't have lasted long anyway, with or without me. Can't say I don't get the same impression here. What are you even supposed to be doing?~
@7154 = ~Someone powerful is trying to kill me. I have to stop them.~
@7155 = ~Helping the innocent, smiting the wicked. What more do you need?~
@7156 = ~Avenging Gorion.~
@7157 = ~Just trying to turn a profit.~
@7158 = ~Uh-huh. So you're being hunted, and your solution is to traipse up and down the coast, showing your face to everyone, looking for "quests" from strangers, and basically drawing as much attention to yourself as possible.~
@7159 = ~Don't question my methods.~
@7160 = ~If they come to me, I don't have to look for them. They're bound to run out of men sooner or later.~
@7161 = ~It sounds stupid when you say it.~
@7162 = ~@1697 /* I have no idea. */ Got it.~
@7163 = ~Then keep your head clear. Some of the stupidest things in the world get done in the name of revenge. We start getting stupid, I start looking for a new job.~
@7164 = ~Yeah. There are quicker and easier ways to make money, champ.~
@7165 = ~Then what are you doing here?~
@7166 = ~Who's questioning? I'm just making sure I understand. If you heard doubt, maybe it's in your head.~
@7167 = ~Or they'll eventually send someone with the sense to shank you in your sleep. You know, rather than strolling right up and yelling "I'm here to kill you!" Take your weapons to bed.~
@7168 = ~And check your food. The way you eat, a poisoner could just plunk the bottle itself in your soup and you still wouldn't notice.~
@7169 = ~And think of a fake name, at least. If it comes to it, you don't want to have to make one up on the spot.~
@7170 = ~Anything else?~
@7171 = ~I have a knack for that.~
@7172 = ~Let's just move on.~
@7173 = ~Plenty, but any more and you'll start thinking I'm concerned. Let's not go there.~
@7174 = ~Do you have any idea how well-equipped I'd be right now if drow gear didn't disintegrate in the sun?~
@7175 = ~I'd always say to them, we need to import some regular iron, start getting a feel for it. We all go on about reclaiming the world above, subjugating the surfacers, blah de blah de blah, and nobody seems to understand that ALL OUR CRAP WOULD MELT.~
@7176 = ~You could just attack at night.~
@7177 = ~I'm grateful, personally. I'd rather not be subjugated.~
@7178 = ~What kind of equipment did you have?~
@7179 = ~Blah de blah de blah indeed. Give it a rest, Vynd.~
@7180 = ~That's a sound strategy. Alright men, you've got exactly twelve hours before literally everything breaks. Make them count.~
@7181 = ~We've talked enough. Let's go.~
@7182 = ~Yeah, well. Doesn't necessarily have to be subjugation. Maybe just pop up every now and then for a decent drink.~
@7183 = ~Elven chain, for one thing. This suit's not bad, but green ain't exactly my colour. Nor is it anyone's. Hopefully surface elves will one day realise that.~
@7184 = ~What else?~
@7185 = ~Fat chance.~
@7186 = ~Elven chain, for one thing. Far better protection than any cheap leather. And more stylish. Dibs on any suits we find, by the way.~
@7187 = ~Ah...that's all, now that I think about it. Obviously I had weapons, couple of trinkets, but nothing that special. Just the chain. I would've given everything else to keep that. I set that chain mail on fire. You have no idea.~
@7188 = ~Sounds impressive. Do all the drow get armour like that?~
@7189 = ~You'll have to make do.~
@7190 = ~They wish. We get chain mail, sure, but not of that quality. Gotta prove you're worth it before they give you the good stuff.~
@7191 = ~I will. Relax, I'm not spoiled. They don't just give you the top-grade stuff right away. You have to earn it.~
@7192 = ~In my city, if a man went above and beyond, he'd be given a suit of tailored adamantine plate. That was more than just armour; it was status. It meant he'd risen as high as a male could go.~
@7193 = ~If you ever meet a male drow with armour like that, aim for the waist. It's designed to leave gaps there. That way, he can still prostrate himself nice and quick.~
@7194 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you seen a little pouch of dust anywhere? I'm sure I set it down just here...~
@7195 = ~Oh, never mind. Found it.~
@7196 = ~Why are you carrying dust around?~
@7197 = ~Righto. Let's go, then.~
@7198 = ~Ah, it's just a...stupid thing. Sentimental. Long story.~
@7199 = ~I'd like to hear it.~
@7200 = ~Never mind, then.~
@7201 = ~It used to be a tentacle rod. Do you know what that is?~
@7202 = ~Some kind of whip, isn't it?~
@7203 = ~No idea.~
@7204 = ~Sounds kinky, whatever it is.~
@7205 = ~It's worse than that. They're covered in teeth. Living fangs that bite into your skin, chew it up, and toxins that necrotize the flesh. Leaves a wound like rotten mincemeat.~
@7206 = ~A few lashes, then they let you savour the sting for a while before they come back. If they ever really went at it, you'd be dead in minutes.~
@7207 = ~Worst part is, they never say how long you'll be there for, so you can't count the time. You can't tell yourself "Only one day left."~
@7208 = ~It...sounds like you really know what you're talking about.~
@7209 = ~So how'd you get a hold of one?~
@7210 = ~Technically, it's a weapon. That's not what they're used for, though. Not most of the time. They work like a whip, but...~
@7211 = ~Oh yeah.~
@7212 = ~I found this particular one when I was out scouting. Some Handmaiden of Lolth managed to get herself slaughtered. Umber hulks. Too proud for a lowly male entourage, I guess. Anyway, the rod was on her corpse, such as it was.~
@7213 = ~Didn't anyone ask about her?~
@7214 = ~And you just went ahead and swiped it?~
@7215 = ~Go on.~
@7216 = ~If they had, I'd be dead. Hell of a risk.~
@7217 = ~It's not like it was just random theft. You don't steal from a handmaiden without a damn good reason, dead or not.~
@7218 = ~I took the thing to a little cave just outside the city, hid it away nice and safe. Then I started saving up for healing potions. Every penny I had, either food or potions.~
@7219 = ~After a few months, I had a good stockpile. And I took it to the place I'd hidden the rod.~
@7220 = ~And I started.~
@7221 = ~Started...?~
@7222 = ~Using it.~
@7223 = ~I wanted to adjust to it. Dull myself to it. The rod is the worst punishment we have. If I could take the rod, I could take anything.~
@7224 = ~It took years. Took everything I had to keep going back to that place, wrenching those teeth out of me. But one day, I went into the cave...and I didn't scream. Then I didn't wince. Then I didn't blink.~
@7225 = ~And the next time I got sent to the torture pits, I stared them in the face and smiled until it was over.~
@7226 = ~I'm so sorry. It must have been horrible.~
@7227 = ~So what happened to the rod?~
@7228 = ~Are you kidding me? It was the best day of my life. They were furious, but they couldn't do a damn thing worse than they were already doing.~
@7229 = ~I took their power away. I *beat* them.~
@7230 = ~But what happened to the rod?~
@7231 = ~What do you think? I shone some light on it, and it fell apart. Like everything we build.~
@7232 = ~Do you know much about Lolth?~
@7233 = ~I picked up a few things in Candlekeep.~
@7234 = ~No more than the next surfacer.~
@7235 = ~Everything. Shut up.~
@7236 = ~If you know Lolth, you more or less know the drow. I'm just wondering what surfacers are actually taught about us, besides "Kill on sight."~
@7237 = ~I might not be the best benchmark. I grew up in a library, you know.~
@7238 = ~I'm really not familiar with her at all.~
@7239 = ~Tell me. We'll see if they were the right things or not.~
@7240 = ~I know she's an evil goddess.~
@7241 = ~I know she's also called the Spider Queen.~
@7242 = ~I know she used to be part of the elven pantheon, before she betrayed them.~
@7243 = ~Actually, now that you've put me on the spot, nothing comes to mind.~
@7244 = ~Let me quote you some scripture, then.~
@7245 = ~All drow must praise and fear Lolth from birth. Questioning the will of Lolth or her clerics is a sin. Kill everyone who doesn't worship Lolth, or says mean things about her.~
@7246 = ~In short, we worship a child. A snotty little brat with far too much power.~
@7247 = ~I take it you're not a follower anymore.~
@7248 = ~She's not the only god with commandments like that.~
@7249 = ~Maybe, but I've got nobody else worth asking right now. Spill it.~
@7250 = ~You and everyone who's ever heard the name before. What else?~
@7251 = ~That's about it, really.~
@7252 = ~Yep. Spiders are considered holy creatures. We actually have to bow to spiders, as if the damn things have any idea what that means.~
@7253 = ~Now that's impressive. Surface elves would love to bury that little tidbit. If you ever want to get under their skin, just say the word "Araushnee" and watch the veins pop.~
@7254 = ~"Anymore." I'm not sure I ever was. Not sure anyone really is. They're just too scared to say it.~
@7255 = ~True, but I'd say she's the worst. You take a god like Bane. Yeah, he was a tyrant, all he wanted was power, but at least he kept his church unified. It had structure. Goals that they actually worked towards.~
@7256 = ~Oh, and let's not forget "Males are inherently inferior." Bane of my sodding existence, that one.~
@7257 = ~I thought drow males really were weaker than females, though.~
@7258 = ~You're not inferior.~
@7259 = ~You do go on about that.~
@7260 = ~Oh, and let's not forget "Males are inherently inferior." Speaking of banes...~
@7261 = ~I mean, uh...~
@7262 = ~Am I wrong?~
@7263 = ~Just saying.~
@7264 = ~I know that. I've always known that. Spreading the word, though, that's the killer.~
@7265 = ~Maybe I do. It defined most of my life. I'm sure you'll have plenty to say about this little drama when it's over.~
@7266 = ~I can take a hint, though. I'll just seethe in silence for a bit.~
@7267 = ~It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. You tell someone they're worthless, treat them like they're worthless, and surprise surprise, they start to feel worthless. So of course they aren't as strong as the women. Why even try to be?~
@7268 = ~You're not worthless, Vynd.~
@7269 = ~You love to talk about this, don't you?~
@7270 = ~You'd make a lousy drow, you know that?~
@7271 = ~And you make a lousy surfacer.~
@7272 = ~What, because I'm kind to people?~
@7273 = ~Thank you.~
@7274 = ~Not now, Vynd.~
@7275 = ~Don't get too catty. Even I'm not sure it was an insult.~
@7276 = ~Yes. Partially. That's not what I'm talking about, though.~
@7277 = ~Was that sarcasm? Because I might actually be complimenting you.~
@7278 = ~Yeah, you'll cross the world collecting garbage on the off chance you'll get a reward, and you almost never make the same choices I would, and you aren't nearly as careful as you should be...~
@7279 = ~But you make it work somehow. You get things done, faster than any of us would, and I've never made one copper betting on you to die. I don't know. Maybe there's something to be said for it. Or you're just lucky.~
@7280 = ~Wait. You've been betting people I'd die?~
@7281 = ~Maybe both.~
@7282 = ~Most people don't pull it off as well as I do.~
@7283 = ~I get things done because I don't stand around talking. Come on.~
@7284 = ~Sometimes I'd hang back for a while after you got one of your little quests. "Ten gold says you'll never see this <PRO_MANWOMAN> again."~
@7285 = ~Stopped doing it a while ago. You were costing me too much.~
@7286 = ~I suppose it's just simpler when you know who to worry about. A hundred enemies in the sun aren't as dangerous as one in the dark.~
@7287 = ~But drow can see in the dark.~
@7288 = ~I hope you're not implying that I'm simple.~
@7289 = ~Not very far, though. I see better in daylight, now that I'm used to it.~
@7290 = ~I am. But that's a good thing up here. Simple world, simple solutions. No need to convolute it.~
@7291 = ~With drow, if there's a problem, you can't just go and fix it. You have to find out who else knows you have a problem. Then you have to figure out if they'll take advantage.~
@7292 = ~Actually, no. You assume they will. Then they become another problem you have to deal with. Pretty soon you've got nothing *but* problems. We're flies caught in Lolth's giant problem web, and nobody can move because then the spiders come.~
@7293 = ~Getting out of there was the smartest thing I've ever done.~
@7294 = ~You really hate the drow, don't you?~
@7295 = ~I agree. But we should move on here.~
@7296 = ~It'll be the second smartest once you stop harping on about it. Let's go.~
@7297 = ~I hated being *with* them. As long as I'm not, I don't give a damn. Let 'em rot.~
@7298 = ~It's more than that. You hate them even more than surfacers do.~
@7299 = ~Never mind. Let's drop it.~
@7300 = ~So what? What the hell do you people know? Unlike surfacers, I've lived it. I'm justified. More than anyone up here can say.~
@7301 = ~Even so, they're your people. Don't you have any respect for them at all?~
@7302 = ~Let's just drop this.~
@7303 = ~Yeah, let's.~
@7304 = ~There's nothing to respect! We're a pack of self-destructive jackasses!~
@7305 = ~Vynd-~
@7306 = ~You know what the drow's favourite hobby is? It's not torture, or fighting, or slavery. It's suicide. We can't get enough of it. Stabbing ourselves in the back, starting blood feuds over the most infantile crap. Blinding ourselves to everything we'd have if we'd put the damn swords down for one minute and realise our best interests can NOT be found in the dogma of a psycho spider bitch.~
@7307 = ~But that conflict is what made you strong.~
@7308 = ~(say nothing)~
@7309 = ~Yeah. And now that we're strong, we can kill ourselves better than any other race in Faerun. Hooray for the drow. Praise Lolth.~
@7310 = ~Uggghh. There. You got a tirade. Happy? Go and find something else to do.~
@7311 = ~Ever hear of House Iyzill?~
@7312 = ~I'm not really up to speed on Underdark societies.~
@7313 = ~I'm not even sure what you mean by "house."~
@7314 = ~No, nor would I care to.~
@7315 = ~Rhetorical question. You wouldn't know about it either way.~
@7316 = ~It's like a drow family. A clan, I guess you'd call it.~
@7317 = ~I had a friend there. Talented, smart. Good fighter. Always knew the right time and place to be. He could have gone far in that world, male or not. ~
@7318 = ~You know what happened to him? He spoke out of turn to the matron of House Zolond. One wisecrack, and she cut his throat right there in front of everybody. Didn't even finish his sentence.~
@7319 = ~Then of course Mother Iyzill loses it and demands restitution for her male. Mother Zolond insists she was justified, so Mother Iyzill declares war and breaks Mother Zolond's neck. Again, right in front of everybody.~
@7320 = ~One wisecrack.~
@7321 = ~And both houses fight and fight and fight until they make fractions of themselves. And once they've bled out, all the other houses dive in to finish them off.~
@7322 = ~And with the two strongest houses gone, the rest of the city collapses into the hole. Illithid, duergar, derro, everyone shows up to take a piece, and the infighting does the rest. Nothing left there now but die-hards and lunatics.~
@7323 = ~What was your friend's name?~
@7324 = ~That was stupid. He should have kept his mouth shut.~
@7325 = ~Yeah, whatever. I'm not out for sympathy. I wanted to complain to someone, nobody else is listening, so it might as well be you.~
@7326 = ~Well, if you need to complain about anything else...~
@7327 = ~Keep it to yourself next time.~
@7328 = ~Does it matter? Not really. Not anymore.~
@7329 = ~He should have. But he shouldn't have had to.~
@7330 = ~I will.~
@7331 = ~What do you think will come of all this?~
@7332 = ~This really isn't the time.~
@7333 = ~When we're done. How big a difference do you think we're making?~
@7334 = ~We're preventing a huge war.~
@7335 = ~There's no telling the damage a powerful madman can do.~
@7336 = ~We're saving lives.~
@7337 = ~I'm out for Sarevok's head. Whatever happens afterwards isn't important.~
@7338 = ~One war? If Baldur's Gate won, do you think it'd end there?~
@7339 = ~No there isn't. Imagine someone like Elminster went insane. Everyone in the world would know it.~
@7340 = ~How many? Thousands? Tens of thousands? Maybe millions? ~
@7341 = ~It is important. You just don't care about it.~
@7342 = ~I just have the feeling...whatever disaster would have happened without us, it would have gone in books. Everywhere. Years from now, people would sort history into before or after the Iron War. The war we're preventing.~
@7343 = ~Just us few.~
@7344 = ~The actions of a few can shape the world. Gorion taught me that.~
@7345 = ~My magnificent leadership doesn't hurt.~
@7346 = ~None of this will matter in the end.~
@7347 = ~I'm starting to think I should have met Gorion.~
@7348 = ~Normally I'd deny that, but...whatever.~
@7349 = ~That's the most useless thing anyone's ever said. Nothing matters in the end. It matters before it.~
@7350 = ~Damn it. Look at you. Crisis after crisis pops up and you chew through them like a bowl of blueberries.~
@7351 = ~What's my excuse? I'm sure I had one. I just can't remember it.~
@7352 = ~You can do whatever you set your mind to.~
@7353 = ~It mustn't have been very good, then.~
@7354 = ~Maybe your crisis is bigger.~
@7355 = ~Are you done navel-gazing? Because I'm hungry for more blueberries.~
@7356 = ~No platitudes. You're ruining it.~
@7357 = ~I think there was more than one, actually. A whole lot of small excuses. They just looked big all piled up.~
@7358 = ~Yeah. I think that was it. It's starting to go limp, though.~
@7359 = ~It's been fun.~
@7360 = ~Going somewhere?~
@7361 = ~Bad time, Vynd. Possibly the worst time.~
@7362 = ~Just letting you know in advance. Here.~
@7363 = ~Let's not kid ourselves. It's been fun. That's it. I'll stick around until this business is cleared up, but after that, you'll wake up one day and I won't be there.~
@7364 = ~I've got work to do. And it's time I took a leaf out of your book and just damn well did it.~
@7365 = ~Are you going back to the Underdark?~
@7366 = ~There's nothing I could do to convince you?~
@7367 = ~I wish you well, then.~
@7368 = ~Good riddance.~
@7369 = ~That's the endgame. Have to round up some stooges for the crawl first. Apparently that's not as insane a prospect as I thought.~
@7370 = ~Maybe I can give them some sob story about how my father was murdered and I'm out for revenge. Seems to work. Not entirely untrue either.~
@7371 = ~More a case of me convincing you, isn't it? You've got your own battles, and I doubt they'll involve the drow. It's another world down there, <CHARNAME>. Only a handful of us to bridge the gap.~
@7372 = ~For now.~
@7373 = ~You too. And don't get killed before I go, otherwise I wasted my time telling you this.~
@7374 = ~Try to be nice and this is what you get. Any wonder I'm a jerk?~
@7375 = ~About time someone sorted this out. One more broken sword and I would have snapped along with it.~
@7376 = ~Why didn't you do it yourself, then?~
@7377 = ~This affected more people than you, you know.~
@7378 = ~And now the smiths can't inflate their prices and blame it on the mines.~
@7379 = ~You're here to sneak, not speak. Let's go.~
@7380 = ~First of all, nobody was paying me to. Secondly, I thought the Fist or the local militia or SOMEBODY might get their act together before the entire coast had to go back to bronze.~
@7381 = ~And what could I have done? Just strolled in and cleared the place out by myself? It takes numbers.~
@7382 = ~And yet it still fell to me to fix it. Funny, that.~
@7383 = ~Ugh, I know. "What with the iron shortage and all." I swear, a while ago some drunkard peed on me, then said his aim had been poor lately what with the iron shortage.~
@7384 = ~Issues like this wouldn't grow so much if people would stop stewing in them and start doing something. Acting together.~
@7385 = ~Yes. People like you.~
@7386 = ~You could have gone after Mulahey. The kobolds would have dispersed without his leadership.~
@7387 = ~Strong people. For every wolf, there are a hundred sheep.~
@7388 = ~I don't do hordes. I do individuals.~
@7389 = ~I doubt it. Mulahey wasn't that smart or that important, judging by those letters.~
@7390 = ~A hundred sheep together could kill a wolf if they actually tried.~
@7391 = ~Are you sure victimising gibberlings isn't more your speed? I signed up to "adventure", not to solve real problems.~
@7392 = ~What are you complaining about? You said you were glad this was taken care of.~
@7393 = ~I'm sure there'll be plenty of gibberlings on the way to Tranzig.~
@7394 = ~There's a whole wide world elsewhere if you don't like it.~
@7395 = ~I am. I'm not glad we had to do it ourselves.~
@7396 = ~So I'm doing double duty? I think we need to discuss my wages.~
@7397 = ~A whole wide world, but not enough fat nobles with rich enemies. I'm out of my element.~
@7398 = ~You realise this bandit issue no longer has anything to do with you.~
@7399 = ~Don't be so sure. I have a good hunch.~
@7400 = ~What are you talking about? The letter said they wanted me dead.~
@7401 = ~That doesn't mean I can't look into it.~
@7402 = ~And my decisions have nothing to do with you. Hush.~
@7403 = ~Yeah, because you need to feel like you're accomplishing something. We could be fighting octopus men in the Great Sea and you'd have that same hunch.~
@7404 = ~It said "a band of mercenaries." That could be anyone. Or do you think you're the only enemy these people have made?~
@7405 = ~The Nashkel mines I can understand. We got paid, we got praised, and now that the coast has good ore again, I can stop looking for an enchanted nail file. But...~
@7406 = ~But?~
@7407 = ~You'd rather have a reward waiting, is what you're saying.~
@7408 = ~You use a nail file?~
@7409 = ~This is a hidden base. Nobody knows about the place, nobody's offering us anything to investigate. All we're looking at is a pat on the back. What's the point?~
@7410 = ~The point is to make the coast a little safer.~
@7411 = ~The point is to kill everyone and loot the place.~
@7412 = ~The point is shut up and do as I say.~
@7413 = ~I'unno.~
@7414 = ~Damn and double damn, you've seen right through me. Here I was trying to convince you I had depth.~
@7415 = ~Yes. I want to get paid. That's the whole reason I'm here.~
@7416 = ~You don't think of me as a friend?~
@7417 = ~These are powerful people, Vynd. We're bound to find some nice loot.~
@7418 = ~What would you have me do, then?~
@7419 = ~...well, yeah. I do rough work. Lot of wear and tear. Ever had to scratch an itch with a ragged nail? It hurts.~
@7420 = ~You use a nail file.~
@7421 = ~I wondered why your fingers were so girly.~
@7422 = ~Whatever. What were you saying?~
@7423 = ~You make things too safe and pretty soon you'll have to find a real job.~
@7424 = ~Anyone worth assassinating will have something to swipe. That doesn't mean you don't charge for the job.~
@7425 = ~Who are we supposed to be charging?~
@7426 = ~Speaking of charge, remind me who's in it.~
@7427 = ~Forgive me, oh leader. I will never again dare to be helpful.~
@7428 = ~Oh please. You know what I am. I don't object to you being alive, and that's as close to friends as we're getting.~
@7429 = ~AND BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN, I wouldn't have told you that if I didn't have some respect for you. I could have just lied.~
@7430 = ~Here's what to do. Let the Fist catch wind of it and wait for the call. "Brave adventurers needed to investigate hidden Cloakwood base." Oh, look at that, we're way ahead of you and my, look at the size of your purse.~
@7431 = ~In the meantime, we find ourselves some good old ruins and have a treasure hunt.~
@7432 = ~It sounds like you're starting to enjoy this.~
@7433 = ~*You* want to go on a treasure hunt?~
@7434 = ~And what if the Fist raids the place first?~
@7435 = ~Look, don't change the subject.~
@7436 = ~I never said that.~
@7437 = ~Okay, maybe it works when more than one person per group isn't an idiot. That doesn't mean I wouldn't sooner do something else.~
@7438 = ~Something else like what?~
@7439 = ~You don't think I'm an idiot? Thanks.~
@7440 = ~Well...no. I assumed you would. That's why I suggested it.~
@7441 = ~Not that I'm saying I wouldn't go. Already threw my lot in. Might as well.~
@7442 = ~Then we're still off somewhere getting rich. Win-win.~
@7443 = ~Don't put me on the spot.~
@7444 = ~You're desperate for a compliment, aren't you? Keep wringing that stone, boss.~
@7445 = ~Baldur's Gate then, is it?~
@7446 = ~Alright, what's wrong now?~
@7447 = ~Unless you have another suggestion.~
@7448 = ~Actually, I'm ready to damn it all and go to Waterdeep.~
@7449 = ~Yes. In silence, preferably.~
@7450 = ~Would you believe me if I said "nothing"? All this wilderness crap is for the surface elves. Give me artificiality any day.~
@7451 = ~Nope. I was going to suggest it myself, if things started slowing down.~
@7452 = ~Either one would suit me.~
@7453 = ~This'll be my first time in a real Sword Coast city, instead of quaint little shack clusters like Nashkel. I'm actually kind of...~
@7454 = ~Nervous?~
@7455 = ~Uh-oh.~
@7456 = ~Excited, alright? I'm excited. I'm allowed some joy in life. Get off my back.~
@7457 = ~So will we have a chance to visit the library?~
@7458 = ~I didn't take you for a reader.~
@7459 = ~Not likely.~
@7460 = ~I hope so. I've missed the place.~
@7461 = ~Yes, because then you'll have to be quiet. Get a move on.~
@7462 = ~Sure. History books, travel journals, magical treatises. Anything factual. You could call me a scholar, but I think "assassin" takes precedence.~
@7463 = ~No fiction?~
@7464 = ~You can learn a lot from a story too.~
@7465 = ~Knowledge for the sake of knowledge?~
@7466 = ~Hey, if you have time to catch up with old friends, I have time to pinch some tomes.~
@7467 = ~And this might be the only time I set foot here. Better make the most of it.~
@7468 = ~Fiction's a watered down version of reality. I come from a culture that drinks spider poison. I do not do "watered down."~
@7469 = ~The best stories are ones that actually happened. No idiot jotting down their daydreams could ever create something as raw and strange and fascinating as the real world.~
@7470 = ~It's hobby from habit. Back home, I'd ask someone a good question, get told not to speak without permission, then hit the books. Pretty soon I learned to skip the first two steps.~
@7471 = ~They must have taught you some things.~
@7472 = ~Even so, don't discount a good novel. It can really make you think, make you feel.~
@7473 = ~I've always said there's no better use for spare time than to broaden your mind.~
@7474 = ~Reading's boring. I'd rather learn through life.~
@7475 = ~I'm sick of places that only keep storybooks. When I read, I want to be learning something.~
@7476 = ~You don't like fiction?~
@7477 = ~You can learn a lot from a story.~
@7478 = ~They teach you what they want you to know, and that's not necessarily the truth.~
@7479 = ~If my history lessons are right, the drow have dominated every single battle we've fought in. And yet somehow we're still skulking in a glorified cave being bitter at surface elves.~
@7480 = ~Odd, that.~
@7481 = ~Everybody writes their own history.~
@7482 = ~I'm surprised you know anything about the world at all, then.~
@7483 = ~I manage to think and feel every day without words on a page to help out. And the more you know, the more your thoughts and feelings are worth.~
@7484 = ~Which is probably why I was fed lies. Make sure I wasn't worth anything.~
@7485 = ~Hey, we do have something in common. How about that. And it only took...how long?~
@7486 = ~Slow-going, though. Pick up some books and you can go from Cormyr to Chult to Halruaa to Mulhorand in a few days. Good luck doing that on foot.~
@7487 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, it's entirely logical and consistent. How dare you, you impudent child.~
@7488 = ~But when you ask what really happened, not everyone answers with a whip.~
@7489 = ~Like I said, books. Best friends I've ever had.~
@7490 = ~The irony is, half the point of joining you was to keep the law off me. Figured if I surrounded myself with surfacers, the Fist might mind their own damn business for once.~
@7491 = ~Even disregarding this incident, you made the wrong choice altogether.~
@7492 = ~What's your point?~
@7493 = ~I didn't mean for things to turn out like this.~
@7494 = ~It had to be done. The Iron Throne's caused enough trouble already.~
@7495 = ~How was I to know this would happen? I never laid a hand on Rieltar.~
@7496 = ~I really don't have time for this.~
@7497 = ~I'd noticed. You should really rein that in. Not that I haven't done worse, but I also made sure nobody found out.~
@7498 = ~Just saying, I'm not happy with you right now. And I'll be even more unhappy if we get caught. So unhappy I might consider escaping prison without you.~
@7499 = ~Vynd, if it comes to that, I'm going to need you. Please.~
@7500 = ~If you do, you weren't worth keeping around anyway.~
@7501 = ~Not if I break your ankles first.~
@7502 = ~Did it have to be done right there in the library? Or was that you being impatient? Guess what my money's on.~
@7503 = ~You should have smelled a rat when "Koveras" introduced himself. I'd have shanked him on the spot if I didn't think you were going somewhere with it.~
@7504 = ~You knew? Why didn't you tell me?!~
@7505 = ~And you think we wouldn't have been jailed for that?~
@7506 = ~Ah, I'm only kidding. I...~
@7507 = ~Ugh. Can't believe I'm saying this, but I kind of want to see this through. It actually feels like I'm doing something. You know? Something important.~
@7508 = ~Something good.~
@7509 = ~About time it dawned on you.~
@7510 = ~I'm doing something important. You're riding my coattails.~
@7511 = ~I thought YOU knew! Are you serious?!~
@7512 = ~Hi, <CHARNAME>! I'm Dynv! WE'VE NEVER MET. Come *on*, <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@7513 = ~Got me there.~
@7514 = ~No, something *important*. Something that'll make an impact.~
@7515 = ~I think it did a while back. I just pretended not to notice.~
@7516 = ~It's amazing how fast your head bloats. This is why I have to be negative. You'd explode without me.~
@7517 = ~How does a man kill so many people and never realise he can affect lives?~
@7518 = ~Careful. Ambition is dangerous.~
@7519 = ~By blinding himself.~
@7520 = ~You have more strength than you think. I only hope you put it to the right purpose.~
@7521 = ~Dangerous to me, or dangerous to other people?~
@7522 = ~...yeah. That sounds about right.~
@7523 = ~Guess we'll never know until I use it.~
@7524 = ~Alright. I'm used to giving guards the slip. If you need advice, now's the time to ask.~
@7525 = ~Whatever you've got.~
@7526 = ~I can manage.~
@7527 = ~I was planning to carve my way through.~
@7528 = ~Can I ask you to keep quiet?~
@7529 = ~Use the sewers. From what I saw, there's grates all over the city. And believe me, they don't smell any worse than the average prison cell.~
@7530 = ~If you do run into the law, slow them down however you can. Entanglement magic. Lead them into a crowd. Throw dirt in their eyes if you have to. Just don't kill them. Do not kill them.~
@7531 = ~If you say so. Just don't go on a killing spree, whatever you do.~
@7532 = ~That's fine if you never want to get within a hundred leagues of Baldur's Gate again.~
@7533 = ~See, most guards don't really care about criminals. They'll pretend to, but they're just maintaining their image. And someone who doesn't care will only chase you so far.~
@7534 = ~Once you start killing them, that makes it personal. That makes them care. And then they'll never stop looking.~
@7535 = ~It almost sounds like you have first-hand experience.~
@7536 = ~I'm surprised you aren't telling us to cut our losses and get out of here.~
@7537 = ~I'm not going to hurt them if I can help it.~
@7538 = ~Let them look. They'll only find their deaths.~
@7539 = ~Let's just say I've toured more than the Sword Coast since I dug my way up.~
@7540 = ~Yeah, well, that's not fixing the problem, is it? That's just running away from it.~
@7541 = ~Oh, I encourage hurting them. Bastards. Just as long as it isn't life-threatening.~
@7542 = ~Nice. I might write that down. Now stop being stupid. By the time you wade through every guard in the city, you'll be facing Emperor Sarevok the Unstoppable.~
@7543 = ~A while ago, I'd have told you to forget the whole thing and move somewhere exotic. But this problem's better fixed than avoided.~
@7544 = ~Okay. I'm sure you're looking forward to your big showdown, but how about we do this my way for a change?~
@7545 = ~Meaning?~
@7546 = ~Why start now?~
@7547 = ~Only if your way involves a big showdown.~
@7548 = ~How about you shush your mouth for a change?~
@7549 = ~You're not slaughtering kobolds or tracking bandits or storming underground bases anymore. All you need is Sarevok dead. One man. One target. One job.~
@7550 = ~One gold.~
@7551 = ~Really? Sarevok's only worth one gold coin?~
@7552 = ~You think you can fight Sarevok alone?~
@7553 = ~I'm not letting you hog the glory.~
@7554 = ~This is my fight. I don't want to risk you.~
@7555 = ~I need to see him fall with my own eyes. It's the only way I can be sure.~
@7556 = ~Oh, he's worth far more than that. Thing is, you've already given me most of it.~
@7557 = ~Knowledge has a price, same as anything else. And this journey has taught me a lot. A lot of things I needed to know.~
@7558 = ~So I've estimated the value, done some sums, and it turns out you've paid all but one gold.~
@7559 = ~Out of curiosity, how much would he have cost in coin alone?~
@7560 = ~And you think you can fight Sarevok by yourself?~
@7561 = ~I'm not going to fight him. I'm going to kill him. There's a difference.~
@7562 = ~So Sarevok's only worth one gold coin?~
@7563 = ~Uh, in my profession, glory is another word for blame. You can have it. As long as I get my payment.~
@7564 = ~Your payment of one gold.~
@7565 = ~How sweet. You know I'd send you if the tables were turned, right?~
@7566 = ~That's you. I'm me.~
@7567 = ~I wouldn't have offered.~
@7568 = ~Oh. In that case, go for it, and I hope you die.~
@7569 = ~I can understand that. I don't see myself cheating you on this one, but I understand.~
@7570 = ~More than you could afford. Maybe more than anyone could.~
@7571 = ~Right. I do want it, you know. You try pulling "Oh, it's only one gold" on me and I'm not doing it.~
@7572 = ~Yeah. You keep being you, then. I won't stop you.~
@7573 = ~Hah. You've got more sense than me.~
@7574 = ~Yeowch. That's gonna cost you two gold, buddy.~
@7575 = ~All together, then. Just us few. Let's change the world.~
@7576 = ~Nobody's impressed, Vynd.~
@7577 = ~Okay, I...I kinda called that. Kinda.~
@7578 = ~Need something?~
@7579 = ~Can you teach me how to poison a weapon?~
@7580 = ~Can we go back to the poisoning lessons?~
@7581 = ~How long have you been on the surface for?~
@7582 = ~Teach me drow sign language!~
@7583 = ~I'd really like to get to know you better.~
@7584 = ~Why darts, Vynd? I thought crossbows were the traditional weapon of drow assassins.~
@7585 = ~Did you ever think about taking up magic?~
@7586 = ~Haven't you ever considered turning over a new leaf? Doing some good in the world?~
@7587 = ~Did you keep slaves back home?~
@7588 = ~Is he ticklish? Is he?~
@7589 = ~What's the biggest target you ever went after?~
@7590 = ~What were you like as a boy?~
@7591 = ~Do you have any friends besides me?~
@7592 = ~What do you really want out of life, Vynd?~
@7593 = ~I've heard there's a god of drow males and thieves. Do you worship him?~
@7594 = ~Tell me a story about the Underdark.~
@7595 = ~Worship Lolth or die. Pick one.~
@7596 = ~Do you think you could ever fall in love?~
@7597 = ~If you could choose to be born again on the surface, would you do it?~
@7598 = ~Can you promise you won't abandon me until this is over?~
@7599 = ~Vynd, Gorion's letter said I'm part of Alaundo's prophecy. I'm one of Bhaal's children.~
@7600 = ~I love you.~
@7601 = ~Aren't you worried Ajantis will make good on his word?~
@7602 = ~"Kid on the cord"? Really, Vynd?~
@7603 = ~You like Coran.~
@7604 = ~I wouldn't make Dorn angry if I were you.~
@7605 = ~Were you and Dynaheir arguing?~
@7606 = ~Do you have some issue with Edwin?~
@7607 = ~You don't think much of Faldorn.~
@7608 = ~I take it you don't care for Garrick's music.~
@7609 = ~You seem kind of irritated by Khalid and Jaheira.~
@7610 = ~Imoen tells me you dumped a load of spiders on her while she slept.~
@7611 = ~We need to talk about Kivan.~
@7612 = ~Seems you have a soft spot for Minsc.~
@7613 = ~Neera's been afraid to cast anything ever since you said that to her.~
@7614 = ~I'm not sure what I was thinking, recruiting you and Shar-Teel both.~
@7615 = ~I noticed you sticking up for Skie earlier.~
@7616 = ~What's your problem with Viconia?~
@7617 = ~By Moradin's hammer!~
@7618 = ~Did you really use to keep count of your assassinations?~
@7619 = ~So how do we turn you back into a mind flayer?~ ~SetGlobal("GV#VYNDPidFlara","GLOBAL",1)~
@7620 = ~Did I hear you correctly? You actually like Littlun?~ ~SetGlobal("GV#VYNDPidLittlun","GLOBAL",1)~
@7621 = ~What makes you so sure Moidre's a duergar?~ ~SetGlobal("GV#VYNDPidMoidre","GLOBAL",1)~
@7622 = ~Want a drink, Vynd?~
@7623 = ~Is this a health check or small talk? If it's the first one, I'm fine. If not, I've got a pounding headache.~
@7624 = ~Bruised. Kinda sore. By drow standards, about normal.~
@7625 = ~See this red trail behind me? That's how I'm doing. How much do you have to bleed before getting some healing in this party?~
@7626 = ~I'm dying. Thanks for asking.~
@7627 = ~Bad.~
@7628 = ~Wait, in regards to what?~
@7629 = ~Just in general.~
@7630 = ~But we're IN the bandit hideout!~
@7631 = ~Baaaaaad.~
@7632 = ~Okay. I was born on the 18th of Flamerule, I enjoy playing darts, and my favourite colour is yellow.~
@7633 = ~I think you know what I was getting at.~
@7634 = ~Mine too! What's your favourite food?~
@7635 = ~And I think you know what I'm getting at. It's not happening, <CHARNAME>.~
@7636 = ~It's...look, we're not doing this, alright?~
@7637 = ~A story? Yeah, alright. What kind do you want? Adventure? Horror?~
@7638 = ~Adventure sounds good.~
@7639 = ~Let's try horror.~
@7640 = ~What about a love story?~
@7641 = ~Actually, don't bother.~
@7642 = ~Hmm. Let's see now...~
@7643 = ~Once upon a time, there lived a terrible monster, bigger than the oldest dragon, fiercer than the vilest demon. Its body was fire from head to toe, and it was said to strike men blind just by looking into their eyes.~
@7644 = ~Now nobody knew why, and nobody ever thought to ask, but this monster stood guard all day long outside the entrance to a huge cave. Or the exit, depending where you're coming from.~
@7645 = ~One morning, as the monster woke from its sleep, it heard footsteps, getting louder and louder. It peered into the cave, and there was this young boy, running as fast as he could, straight at the monster.~
@7646 = ~So the monster stood up tall and showed itself in all its terrible radiance. But the boy didn't stop. Then it reached into the cave and filled it with searing heat, enough to bake the boy in his clothes. But the boy didn't stop.~
@7647 = ~So then the monster looked into the boy's eyes, and just like the stories said, it struck him blind. But even though the boy could see nothing but white, he still kept running and running.~
@7648 = ~And the monster wasn't used to this. Not at all. So it said to the boy "Are you without fear, little one?"~
@7649 = ~"No," said the boy.~
@7650 = ~"Then why do you not run from me?"~
@7651 = ~And the boy pointed behind him, to where the monster couldn't see.~
@7652 = ~And there in the darkness was a spider. Bigger than the oldest dragon. Fiercer than the vilest demon. Bigger and fiercer even than the monster of fire. Its venom ate away mind, body and soul, and the webs it spun could never be broken. And just like the monster, it had the power to blind a man. But it didn't need to look into his eyes.~
@7653 = ~"Because I'm already running from that."~
@7654 = ~Ah, now this is a short one, but very cerebral. Once you hear this, you will rethink everything, and I mean EVERYTHING about the world, every tiny facet of existence, and it's only two words long. Are you ready for it?~
@7655 = ~Gay beholders.~
@7656 = ~Wh...~
@7657 = ~Those eye monsters? The floating...?~
@7658 = ~How did...how can...~
@7659 = ~There aren't any. Too bad.~
@7660 = ~Okay, first of all, how in the hells do you know that?~
@7661 = ~Reading.~
@7662 = ~Rumours.~
@7663 = ~Right. Well, maybe my being up here didn't give it away, but I'm not a huge fan of tradition.~
@7664 = ~I just like darts. I played with them a lot when I was young, and soon enough I realised they could kill someone. Very drow of me, I know.~
@7665 = ~They tried to force a crossbow on me, but I put them off it the day I killed an umber hulk by myself. Poison dart, between the chitin, straight into whatever organ they have in there, and down it went before it even got near us. After that, they decided, yeah, let's just let him have his way.~
@7666 = ~First real decision I ever got to make.~
@7667 = ~HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.~
@7668 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. You harlequin, you.~
@7669 = ~...well, you take a weapon. Preferably a sharp one? And you put poison on it.~
@7670 = ~I don't get it.~
@7671 = ~Wait, start again. You take a weapon...?~
@7672 = ~Later. I'll teach you later.~
@7673 = ~Look. It's childishly simple. Literally, I did this when I was eight.~
@7674 = ~Here is the blade. Here is the poison. Put the poison on the blade, keep it tilted down so it doesn't get on your hand. There. Poison weapon. Try it.~
@7675 = ~I'm still not sure I get it.~
@7676 = ~What are you doing? Hold it by the hilt!~
@7677 = ~Just...just leave the poisoning to me, alright? That's my thing. You do your thing.~
@7678 = ~WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?~
@7679 = ~Little early, isn't it?~
@7680 = ~Hah, just kidding. Red wine, make it a double. I dunno if there's such a thing as a double wine, but ask.~
@7681 = ~Red wine, make it a double. I dunno if there's such a thing as a double wine, but ask.~
@7682 = ~Ha ha ha, like hell. You will never live long enough for me to trust you with that secret. I'm amazed you even know about it.~
@7683 = ~But I'm an elf. I'll live as long as you.~
@7684 = ~What does it matter? You're not in the Underdark anymore.~
@7685 = ~You realise I will bug you about this.~
@7686 = ~FINE, I DIDN'T WANT TO LEARN IT ANYWAY.~
@7687 = ~Oh, you think you'll die of old age? Very optimistic.~
@7688 = ~Not now. You never know.~
@7689 = ~You realise there is nothing keeping me in this party.~
@7690 = ~It's adorable how you think I got a choice.~
@7691 = ~If my mother had wanted a mage, you'd be asking if I ever thought about taking up sneaky bastardry. But she wanted an assassin. So I had to give her one.~
@7692 = ~Why not just ignore her?~
@7693 = ~I'm surprised you didn't tell her to sod off.~
@7694 = ~You could always start now.~
@7695 = ~I did. Once.~
@7696 = ~Only once, I take it.~
@7697 = ~Let me guess. She had you tortured until you couldn't see straight.~
@7698 = ~If I could find the time, sure. Magic's hard enough to learn in a class with a tutor. On the road by myself? I'll stick to what I know.~
@7699 = ~She killed me. Literally. I have died.~
@7700 = ~She didn't shout or try to scare me at all. She didn't even look angry. Just strode right up and smashed my head in like swatting a fly.~
@7701 = ~Then she raised me from the dead and told me if I ever disobeyed her again, I wouldn't come back. Simple as that.~
@7702 = ~Me personally? No. The family had plenty, though.~
@7703 = ~I hope you treated them well.~
@7704 = ~Would you have some to yourself if you got the chance?~
@7705 = ~That must have been wonderful. I'd love a good horde of cowering minions.~
@7706 = ~I didn't bother with them. I've always said pouring yourself a drink takes less effort than whipping someone until they do it for you.~
@7707 = ~They're more trouble than they're worth, if you ask me. What can some scared, malnourished surfacer do for me that I couldn't do better myself?~
@7708 = ~Stupid, really. The whole point of slavery is free labour, right? But it's not free. Raids cost money. Training costs money. And there's only so much you can mistreat someone before they decide dying can't be worse. Then it's rebellion or suicide. More money.~
@7709 = ~And what would you suggest?~
@7710 = ~But don't the drow rely on slave labour?~
@7711 = ~Well. Your heart's not in the right place, but at least your mind is.~
@7712 = ~Decent food, a couple of gold pieces a month and a little autonomy. That's all it'd take. If they're more afraid of what's outside the city than what's inside, they won't go anywhere.~
@7713 = ~Or, if you absolutely must have slaves instead of servants, stop capturing and start breeding. If they're born into it, if they don't know anything else, then they'll accept it.~
@7714 = ~How can you be so clinical?~
@7715 = ~That didn't apply to you.~
@7716 = ~You're wrong. Only fear and pain can keep people in line.~
@7717 = ~Yeah, and whose fault is that?~
@7718 = ~My heart's in my chest, not my head. That is the right place.~
@7719 = ~Clinical is big a step up from sadistic.~
@7720 = ~No. I'm an exception. Sadly, a rare one.~
@7721 = ~Gods, you're such a poser. "Look, Vynd, my twenty years of cooking and cleaning in a library have taught me that only the strong prevail!"~
@7722 = ~Clever. Now whether I say yes or no, I'm implicitly calling you a friend. I guess there's no way to answer that question.~
@7723 = ~Oh wait, there is one. "Up yours."~
@7724 = ~Drow don't make friends. We make enemies. Seriously, we're encouraged to form rivalries the second we know how to talk. "Competition weeds out the weak."~
@7725 = ~What happens to weak children?~
@7726 = ~Wow. No wonder you're so insufferable.~
@7727 = ~But you, being the rebel you are, made some anyway. Right?~
@7728 = ~What do you think?~
@7729 = ~Explains it all, doesn't it? Oh, and up yours again.~
@7730 = ~That might have been nice. Problem is, it has to go both ways.~
@7731 = ~Get paid.~
@7732 = ~But to what end? What's it all for?~
@7733 = ~Me too. Good to know.~
@7734 = ~Getting paid.~
@7735 = ~I don't know, what does anyone want money for? Food. Drink. Lodging. Living.~
@7736 = ~And that's all you want? Just to live?~
@7737 = ~What about happiness? Love? Fulfilment?~
@7738 = ~What about power? Fame? Influence?~
@7739 = ~To live free. That's not as small as you make it sound.~
@7740 = ~Can't have those without the first four, can you?~
@7741 = ~I already did.~
@7742 = ~Vhaeraun? I can see why you'd think that, but no. He has some good ideas and some bad ideas, just like any god. Except Lolth. She's all bad ideas.~
@7743 = ~So you don't follow any god at all?~
@7744 = ~What don't you like about him?~
@7745 = ~Why not follow Eilistraee?~
@7746 = ~Alright. I was just curious.~
@7747 = ~But that's madness! Do you know what the gods do to the faithless?~
@7748 = ~Keep looking. There must be one god that's right for you.~
@7749 = ~What's wrong with Vhaeraun, then?~
@7750 = ~What about Eilistraee?~
@7751 = ~See you in the Wall, then.~
@7752 = ~Your typical Vhaeraunite sermon starts like this. Unify the drow! Equality between male and female! Reintegrate with the surface world! At this point, I'm listening.~
@7753 = ~Then it goes on. Other races are still inferior! Random violence is still great as long as it's aimed at them! I'm now walking out.~
@7754 = ~Oh, and don't forget to make regular offerings of wealth to Vhaeraun! Now I've stolen the donation bowl.~
@7755 = ~Yes. I also know what the drow do to the faithless. That didn't stop me.~
@7756 = ~You escaped the drow, Vynd. There's no escaping the gods.~
@7757 = ~I still say you should keep looking. There must be one god that's right for you.~
@7758 = ~What's wrong with Vhaeraun?~
@7759 = ~Fine. You make the decision, you handle the consequences.~
@7760 = ~In an ideal world, maybe. I'd have thought you'd realised we aren't living in one of those.~
@7761 = ~So you say. Besides, what good would it do? Unless I find one that fits me, I'll just be wearing the colours and reciting the prayers and not meaning any of it. Might as well pick out of a hat.~
@7762 = ~The gods wasted their time with the Wall. They put it up to scare people into believing, but they'll still know in the end. They'll know who had real faith and who was just afraid.~
@7763 = ~I don't think I'll be lonely in there.~
@7764 = ~Hah! You really think those twirly fruitbaskets would have me? More to the point, do you think I'd want them to? It's like they tallied up every limpwristed fairy frill of elven society and said "Right, we can beat this."~
@7765 = ~If you ever catch me frolicking naked in the moonlight, behead me. I'm serious.~
@7766 = ~Say what you like, but I hope you will one day.~
@7767 = ~Only when I'm done watching.~
@7768 = ~You needn't have said.~
@7769 = ~Uh...is that a hypothetical or a threat?~
@7770 = ~Actually, never mind. Same answer either way.~
@7771 = ~I could say the words, but what's the point? My promises aren't worth their weight in dirt and you know it.~
@7772 = ~Then how do I know I can trust you?~
@7773 = ~Just say it. I need to hear it.~
@7774 = ~I have no use for companions that aren't loyal, Vynd.~
@7775 = ~You don't. Nor do you know you can trust anyone else.~
@7776 = ~You can be *fairly sure* you can trust me because I've had thousands of opportunities to kill you and not taken any. And because you haven't given me a reason to leave.~
@7777 = ~If you ever do, I'll tell you, and you can trust that because no force in the realms can close my mouth when I'm annoyed.~
@7778 = ~Fine. I promise I will not abandon <CHARNAME> until this is over, provided <PRO_HESHE> doesn't start getting needy on me.~
@7779 = ~I think that's the first time I've ever said "I promise." Hell of a way to start.~
@7780 = ~Then boy do I have some looong overdue news for you.~
@7781 = ~Do you know what I'm talking about?~
@7782 = ~If this changes anything, you need to tell me now.~
@7783 = ~I'll understand if you'd rather not stay.~
@7784 = ~So there you go. Have fun digesting that.~
@7785 = ~Yeah, I...yeah. I read. I was just wondering if you've ever heard of a lead-in.~
@7786 = ~Well, there you go. Let's move on.~
@7787 = ~Now? I can't get a few days to process you being a literal demigod?~
@7788 = ~Okay, well...I wouldn't have guessed if you hadn't told me, so I suppose it doesn't matter much.~
@7789 = ~I say we just continue as we are. I'll keep on being your man in the shadows and you keep on not being a snarling avatar of murder.~
@7790 = ~That's what we call a drow baptism. It's considered quite an honour. Especially if they start biting.~
@7791 = ~Don't ever do it again.~
@7792 = ~I'm sure it is.~
@7793 = ~Isn't giving one to a surfacer some kind of sacrilege?~
@7794 = ~Hey, all in good fun. They weren't dangerous or anything. I'm not going to kill the kid over a little ribbing.~
@7795 = ~Ha ha you think I made that up.~
@7796 = ~Oh, absolutely. Otherwise I'd have used any old bugs.~
@7797 = ~Was I sticking up for Skie? I thought I was sticking it up Eldoth.~
@7798 = ~But you wouldn't have done that if he weren't treating Skie so badly. Right?~
@7799 = ~You keep telling yourself that.~
@7800 = ~And what's your grief with him?~
@7801 = ~<CHARNAME>, if Skie was being eaten by wolves, I'd pass them the salt. It's not about her.~
@7802 = ~I'm a little sick of hearing who or what should "know their place." Men, women, children, surfacers, anyone who isn't a drow, anyone who isn't Lolth, whatever. Your place is whatever you damn well make it.~
@7803 = ~Eldoth's going to learn that. One way or the other.~
@7804 = ~You're thinking too narrow. I've got no problem with Viconia. I've got a problem with Lolthite shrews who think they own me.~
@7805 = ~But Viconia worships Shar now.~
@7806 = ~Even so, I need you to get along for the sake of the group.~
@7807 = ~Fair enough.~
@7808 = ~And yet she still acts like a pair of breasts are a crown and sceptre. Who encourages that belief? Here's a clue; it's not Shar.~
@7809 = ~I don't care who she prays to at night. She's a Lolthite. Always will be.~
@7810 = ~So why are you talking to me? Tell her I'm not her dog and we're golden. And explain it like you would to a toddler, 'cause she learned that before the alphabet.~
@7811 = ~Are you saying you wouldn't taunt her if she didn't give you orders?~
@7812 = ~Fine. I'll have a word with her.~
@7813 = ~Of course I would. Just not as angrily.~
@7814 = ~Like this, but slightly more huggable. Why?~
@7815 = ~I just have a hard time imagining drow children.~
@7816 = ~I was wondering if you used to be different. If something changed you.~
@7817 = ~No reason.~
@7818 = ~That's because they don't exist. There are big drow and little drow, but no children.~
@7819 = ~What about drow babies? There have to be drow babies.~
@7820 = ~That's sad to hear.~
@7821 = ~But the little drow are the children. Aren't they?~
@7822 = ~A lot of things tried very hard to change me. It was quite a struggle to stay the way I am.~
@7823 = ~And if a hundred years marinating in blood and venom didn't do it, a few kind words from you won't either. Or moral lectures, or whatever you're about to give me. Don't bother.~
@7824 = ~I wasn't going to.~
@7825 = ~Regardless, I'm sorry you weren't raised in better circumstances.~
@7826 = ~Fine. Be that way.~
@7827 = ~<CHARNAME>, if your typical drow mother had her way, we'd skip that phase of our lives entirely.~
@7828 = ~Not that I necessarily blame them there. Screaming little turdlings.~
@7829 = ~You were a baby once.~
@7830 = ~I happen to love babies.~
@7831 = ~Agreed.~
@7832 = ~It's how it is.~
@7833 = ~I was trying to be...never mind.~
@7834 = ~No? You weren't hoping to hear how I used to be such a good young lad? People don't just ask about your childhood without a reason.~
@7835 = ~I'm sure you are. You know, if your heart bleeds for every bad childhood in the world, you'll haemorrhage to death.~
@7836 = ~Don't remind me.~
@7837 = ~No seriously, don't remind me. I was probably getting tortured for not contributing anything.~
@7838 = ~I already know your head's not on straight, but thank you for confirming it regardless.~
@7839 = ~Couldn't you just kick them? Like, out of the building? Into your mother's spider pit?~
@7840 = ~...please tell me you didn't.~
@7841 = ~Wearing spiked sabatons?~
@7842 = ~Well you're weird and your social skills are crippled. Quit flaunting it.~
@7843 = ~Ah, the mysteries of life.~
@7844 = ~<CHARNAME>! Don't be so vicious. Babies are the future.~
@7845 = ~Hah. <CHARNAME>, I do not flirt. I'm a thief. If I see something I want, nobody knows it's been taken until it's far too late.~
@7846 = ~I have no idea what that means.~
@7847 = ~If you say so.~
@7848 = ~Me neither. Sounded good though, didn't it?~
@7849 = ~Oh yes it is. He wouldn't call it fairness, but he'd never hide from someone or cut their throat in their sleep. Everyone has to know he's the big man, and that's not how big men fight. Which is why big men are my favourite men.~
@7850 = ~To kill, I mean.~
@7851 = ~Really should have thought about that before hiring a BLACKGUARD.~
@7852 = ~Wait, I blanked out. Who are we talking about?~
@7853 = ~That's either leading to a discussion I don't want to have, or it's a stupid, pointless question. Either way, not answering it.~
@7854 = ~Uhhhh...~
@7855 = ~Do you love me?~
@7856 = ~Could you tell I wasn't a native if it weren't for the skin?~
@7857 = ~Probably not.~
@7858 = ~I was hoping for a number.~
@7859 = ~The utter disregard for life gives it away.~
@7860 = ~There's your answer, then. And it's the best one I can give you.~
@7861 = ~Who's counting? I'm not even sure how old I am beyond "a hundred and something."~
@7862 = ~If you think that's drow-exclusive, you need to pay more attention to the world.~
@7863 = ~I never had seasons, I never had a sun, and I'm not counting on getting elderly. There comes a point when a year doesn't mean anything.~
@7864 = ~He will end you. Yes he will.~
@7865 = ~I am proud to be the first drow female who can see anything besides her own colon.~
@7866 = ~But seriously, get it off.~
@7867 = ~My mother.~
@7868 = ~That's horrible!~
@7869 = ~This sounds like a story.~
@7870 = ~I think that tells me everything I need to know about everything.~
@7871 = ~What, were you hoping for a soothing bedtime story about contract killing?~
@7872 = ~To you, maybe. Just another day in the Underdark.~
@7873 = ~A rival house fancied their chances, so they made the usual offer. "Once we've seized power, you will have wealth, status, slaves, etcetera." I'd have been lucky to get "etcetera."~
@7874 = ~But you still agreed to it?~
@7875 = ~I just wanted to teach her a lesson, frankly. If you're going to train your son to assassinate people, be nice to him at dinner.~
@7876 = ~I couldn't do it in the end, though.~
@7877 = ~So even drow love their mothers.~
@7878 = ~What happened?~
@7879 = ~Bored now. Let's go.~
@7880 = ~Oh, I tried. I meant I couldn't pull it off.~
@7881 = ~She had a polymorphed body double sleep in her bedroom. Can you believe that? It was probably never even her bedroom in the first place. Gods know where it really was.~
@7882 = ~Anyway, I killed the double just fine. But her death set off a magical alarm, and pretty soon I was chained naked to a wall with my actual mother glaring at me.~
@7883 = ~I don't imagine she took it well.~
@7884 = ~I've had that nightmare.~
@7885 = ~You never told me this story was steamy.~
@7886 = ~Better than you'd think. I got the usual torture session, but she said she'd let me live if I told her who wanted her dead. Which I did.~
@7887 = ~So that was that. It worked to her advantage, and I think part of her was impressed I had the brass to try.~
@7888 = ~Have you lived it? Because there's a difference, my friend. A big goddamned difference.~
@7889 = ~I'll tell you what else it is; over. Freak.~
@7890 = ~Because we spend a lot of time marching and I'm allergic to tedium. Same reason I antagonise anyone.~
@7891 = ~You don't usually make it so personal.~
@7892 = ~Well stop it. I don't need you two fighting.~
@7893 = ~Save it, Vynd. There's more to it than that. I'm not stupid, and if you're going to act like I am, you can leave.~
@7894 = ~If there's a problem, you can tell me. It's my responsibility to handle these things. Whatever it is, I'll listen.~
@7895 = ~Actually, let's not talk about Kivan.~
@7896 = ~People don't usually give me something personal to work with.~
@7897 = ~Never mind. I'm obviously not going to get a straight answer here.~
@7898 = ~There'll only be a fight if he starts one.~
@7899 = ~Well hell, I don't know. Keeping company with an angry, unstable, drow-hating ranger? If you don't see the issue, you *are* stupid and I *am* going to act like it.~
@7900 = ~And how is provoking him supposed to help?~
@7901 = ~Then maybe you should go before things get violent.~
@7902 = ~Goodness. How lucky I am to have such a considerate leader, who thinks nothing of having me camp with an angry, unstable, drow-hating ranger.~
@7903 = ~He's a danger to me and the whole party. If you have any sense at all, you'll get rid of him.~
@7904 = ~That doesn't answer the question.~
@7905 = ~Are you trying to start a fight? You think I'll take your side if he attacks you?~
@7906 = ~He wouldn't be a danger if you'd leave him alone!~
@7907 = ~Excellent idea.~
@7908 = ~Doesn't it? Well, I wouldn't want to spoonfeed it to you. That would insult your intelligence.~
@7909 = ~If?~
@7910 = ~When he takes his shot, I'm going to be awake, and I'm going to see it coming. Maybe you'll side with me, or maybe you'll side with the revenge-monger who went berserk and tried to kill an ally because they teased him. Up to you. ~
@7911 = ~Words are words, <CHARNAME>. Killing is killing. One's my hobby and the other's my job, so believe me when I say there's a difference.~
@7912 = ~But hey, if you think he likes drow assassins as long as they're polite, ask him yourself. I'm sure he'll set you straight.~
@7913 = ~Not really. That kid's stick is so far up his arse, I can twiddle it and scramble his brain.~
@7914 = ~Besides, if he ever does decide to kill me, I can just dart him and run while he's announcing it to the world.~
@7915 = ~Was that too dark? I can never tell up here.~
@7916 = ~Do I? News to me.~
@7917 = ~You do. I caught you flirting with him.~
@7918 = ~Oh. My mistake, then.~
@7919 = ~He's not nearly as scary as he thinks. I'm sure he'd slaughter me in a fair fight, but that's not how I work.~
@7920 = ~I don't think it's how he works either.~
@7921 = ~I'd rather not have my companions slaughtering each other in any respect.~
@7922 = ~On your own head be it.~
@7923 = ~Yeah, turns out stuck-up bitches live outside the Underdark too. Who knew?~
@7924 = ~Oh, Edwin's great. Please never, ever get rid of Edwin. The more inflated something is, the more fun you have popping it.~
@7925 = ~And you do? I don't know how anyone can take that garbage seriously. When even other druids are saying you have dumb opinions on nature, it's time to reconsider being alive.~
@7926 = ~Actually, I think it's alright. I just like messing with him.~
@7927 = ~Well, I do hate difficult choices. I can't decide whether to blame the woman for stomping on his face or blame the man for letting it happen.~
@7928 = ~I know Jaheira's harsh sometimes, but she means well.~
@7929 = ~I don't think you give Khalid enough credit. He stands up for himself when it counts.~
@7930 = ~Jaheira's a domineering harpy. Blame her.~
@7931 = ~Khalid left his backbone at the wedding. Blame him.~
@7932 = ~Blame both. Problem solved.~
@7933 = ~Do we now.~
@7934 = ~Why are you antagonising him?~
@7935 = ~Isn't he gorgeous?~
@7936 = ~If Minsc ever figured out I've got exactly the sort of butt he wants to kick, I'd almost let him do it so he wouldn't be disappointed.~
@7937 = ~Almost.~
@7938 = ~Then I've just increased our chances of survival. You're welcome.~
@7939 = ~I'm not sure what you were thinking recruiting her at all. Is she bitchier than batty, or battier than bitchy? Answer: Nobody cares, kick her out.~
@7940 = ~THANK YOU.~
@7941 = ~When I was younger, yeah. I figured it'd be a point of pride once I counted high enough.~
@7942 = ~I know better now. Professionals can't afford pride. You get proud, then you start thinking certain methods are "beneath you". Cuts down your options. And your lifespan.~
@7943 = ~Oh, I don't know. Probably by some vague, conveniently unobtainable means that I'll never fully be able to explain, thereby forcing you to take my word for it.~
@7944 = ~Flara could be telling the truth, you know.~
@7945 = ~It's all pretty far-fetched, I must admit.~
@7946 = ~There has to be something we can do. Have you tried dispelling it?~
@7947 = ~She could be, but it's a lot less likely and a lot less fun for me. Don't spoil it.~
@7948 = ~Her being a dragon or me being a mind flayer? You'd better not be accusing me of lying for attention, <CHARNAME>. If I have to eat your brain to prove it, I will.~
@7949 = ~<CHARNAME>...you do realise I'm...~
@7950 = ~Uh, yes. Anyway, you should defer to me on all decisions from now on, because as a mind flayer I'm very smart and very superior to you. First order of business is to put me in charge of loot distribution.~
@7951 = ~Heh. I did say that, yeah, but mostly because I knew she'd hate it.~
@7952 = ~Mostly?~
@7953 = ~Thank the gods. You had me worried there.~
@7954 = ~If you two ever want some alone time, just let me know.~
@7955 = ~She's less intolerable than I expected. Very down-to-earth. Which makes sense, seeing as she's closer to it than most.~
@7956 = ~What, you think I was muscling in? The roguish paramour come to steal her away? You know who she'd choose, but I'll be the better man and step down. Help yourself, <CHARNAME>. To all three feet of it.~
@7957 = ~Kind of like how you said that because you knew *I'd* hate it. Thanks for the thought, but I don't fancy having to take a ladder into the bedroom.~
@7958 = ~Seriously? Alright. Let's assume she refuses to show her face because she's pug ugly. It's plausible. There's still the grim, unrelenting work ethic, the intense aversion to conversation, and the ability to hold ungodly amounts of grog.~
@7959 = ~And I know what you're thinking. "Oh, she's a dwarf, they can all do that." No. I've seen surface dwarves drink before. This is something else. That pit has no bottom.~
@7960 = ~You'll see. She'll slip up sooner or later. Either that or she'll get killed and we can finally unscrew the helmet. Not that I would ever wish for such a thing.~
@7961 = ~So we're done? There won't be a refund, if that's what you're after.~
@7962 = ~Head back to the Friendly Arm for now.~
@7963 = ~Just wait here. I won't be long.~
@7964 = ~Wait, what? Never mind, then.~
@7965 = ~For now? Alright. If you're back quick enough, maybe I won't charge you again.~
@7966 = ~Better not be. I get bored easy.~
@7967 = ~And here I was just getting used to you. Sure you want to cut this short?~
@7968 = ~I changed my mind. Maybe you should stay.~
@7969 = ~Hurry back. I want to see how this plays out.~
@7970 = ~Couldn't manage without me, huh?~
@7971 = ~I can't imagine what I was thinking. Welcome back, Vynd.~
@7972 = ~Fall in, meatshield.~
@7973 = ~Actually, I just came by to show you I could. Farewell.~
@7974 = ~I'm just the help, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You'll be wanting to talk to master Sigurd.~
@7975 = ~Are you aware there's a temple of Talos next door to you?~
@7976 = ~Painfully so. The racket from that damned hut could reach the Cloud Peaks.~
@7977 = ~I hear them plotting to seize my home, every so often. They think my "spinny lightning doodad" would make an excellent monument. Fortunately, my golems are merely invigorated by electricity.~
